title: "Daily Crypto Market Brief - Bitcoin Breaks $90K as Crypto Risk-Off Deepens"
date: 2026-01-21
category: crpyto
---

### **MARKET OVERVIEW**

Bitcoin slipped below \$90,000 amid global risk-off sentiment and regulatory uncertainty, closing the session at \$89,409 (−1.80% 24h). Ethereum declined sharply to \$2,965.95 (−4.94% 24h), exacerbating a week of weakness that saw ETH lose 10.96% since January 14. The broader market capitalization contracted 2.241% to \$3.01 trillion, with altcoins showing mixed pressure: BNB −4.31%, SOL −1.11%, XRP −1.31%, and DOGE −0.99%. Stablecoin supply reached a new all-time high of \$310.4 billion on January 16, with USDT commanding \$186.6 billion and USDC at \$76.6 billion, signaling sustained liquidity readiness despite spot price volatility.[^1][^2][^3]

**Derivatives Context**: Bitcoin futures open interest recovered to \$61+ billion (13% gain since January 1), though still 33% below October's peak of \$92 billion. In a structural shift, Bitcoin options open interest has surpassed futures open interest for the first time, reaching \$74.1 billion. The \$100,000 strike dominates options positioning with ~\$2 billion in notional exposure, indicating traders are preparing for volatility around psychological levels rather than chasing leverage. Funding rates remain modestly positive, but have cooled from early-January peaks, suggesting waning bullish conviction. Liquidations have accelerated: BNB derivatives saw \$4.9 million in liquidations over 24 hours (January 21), with 96% attributed to long position unwinds.[^4][^5][^6]

**ETF Flows**: Early January's optimistic inflows of \$1.16 billion (Jan 1–2) reversed sharply, with Bitcoin ETFs recording \$1.128 billion in outflows over three consecutive trading days (January 6–8). Ether ETFs posted \$68.6 million in weekly net redemptions. However, institutional demand remains fragmented: Trend Research executed a \$75.54 million ETH purchase (24,555 coins) on January 21, suggesting selective interest at lower levels.[^7][^8][^9]

### **TOP HEADLINES**

**1. Delaware Life Launches First Bitcoin-Linked Annuity (Jan 20) — Medium Risk**[^10][^11]
Delaware Life announced a partnership with BlackRock to offer fixed indexed annuities (FIAs) featuring the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index. The offering, available across three FIA products (Momentum Growth, Growth Plus, Dual Income), marks the first instance of a U.S. insurance provider offering cryptocurrency exposure within a regulated annuity structure, providing downside protection alongside Bitcoin participation. This signals institutional-grade mainstream adoption through traditional finance channels.[^10]

**2. U.S. Treasury Commits Seized Bitcoin to Strategic Reserve (Jan 19, Davos) — Medium Risk**[^12][^13]
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent affirmed at the World Economic Forum that the administration will halt sales of seized Bitcoin and retain all forfeited assets in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, established by Executive Order 14233 (March 2025). The U.S. government holds approximately 198,000 BTC (~\$17 billion worth as of October 2025), with no future liquidations planned. This policy removes a historical overhang of government-forced Bitcoin sales and aligns with pro-crypto administration objectives.[^14][^12]

**3. CME Launches Regulated Futures for Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar (Jan 14) — Low Risk**[^15]
CME Group announced the addition of ADA, LINK, and AVAX futures contracts to its CFTC-regulated offerings, broadening institutional access to altcoin derivatives beyond the existing BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL suite. The expansion reflects rising institutional demand for regulated altcoin exposure and intensifying competition among Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitnomial to distribute compliant crypto derivatives.[^15]

**4. Bybit \$1.4 Billion Exploit — Largest in Crypto History (Feb 21 origin, ongoing laundering) — High Risk**[^16][^17]
The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group exploited a Safe multisignature wallet UI spoofing vulnerability to drain approximately 401,000 Ethereum (~\$1.4 billion at the time of theft) from Bybit's cold wallet. The attacker misled wallet signers into approving a malicious transaction by masking the transaction payload. Approximately \$300 million has already been converted to Bitcoin and routed through privacy mixers (Tornado Cash, Wasabi Wallet) for laundering. Bybit replenished customer funds from reserves; the Lazarus Bounty program continues to track and freeze illicit assets.[^17][^16]

**5. Truebit DeFi Protocol Hacked for \$26.5 Million (Jan 8) — Medium Risk**[^18]
The Truebit protocol suffered an exploit in which an attacker manipulated smart contract pricing logic to mint unlimited TRU tokens at zero cost, subsequently draining ETH reserves through rapid buy-sell cycles. The TRU token price collapsed approximately 100% within hours. Security firm PeckShield linked the attack to the same actor responsible for the prior Sparkle exploit (early January 2026), indicating organized, repeated targeting of DeFi pricing mechanisms.[^18]

**6. U.S. Regulatory Framework Crystallizes: Two-Track Approach (SEC/CFTC Split) — Medium Risk**[^19][^20]
Consensus is forming around a bifurcated regulatory model: the SEC will oversee digital investment assets (securities), while the CFTC regulates digital commodities. The CLARITY Act, previously scheduled for Senate Banking Committee markup, was postponed after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong withdrew support over provisions restricting stablecoin interest and DeFi developer protections. CFTC Chair Selig launched a "Future-Proof" initiative to rewrite crypto rules aligned with blockchain market structure, signaling a pro-innovation stance. The Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled to markup its version on January 27.[^21][^22][^23][^19]

**7. Ethereum Foundation Releases zkEVM Security Roadmap (Dec 18, ongoing milestones) — Low Risk**[^24]
The Ethereum Foundation shifted its technical focus from raw performance to provable security for zero-knowledge EVMs. Milestones include February 2026 validation via soundcalc, May 2026 (100-bit provable security), and December 2026 (128-bit security with proofs capped at 300 kilobytes). Upcoming Glamsterdam and Heze-Bogota network upgrades target 10,000 transactions per second alongside zero-knowledge privacy enhancements, reinforcing Ethereum's scaling narrative.[^24]

**8. Bitcoin Basis Trade Unwind — Wall Street Deleveraging (Jan 20) — Low Risk**[^25]
CME Bitcoin futures open interest collapsed below \$10 billion from a peak of \$21 billion as Wall Street pulled back from profitable carry trades, signaling retrenchment in institutional positioning amid basis compression and volatility.[^25]

***

### **RESEARCH & TECHNICAL REPORTS**

- **Ethereum Foundation zkEVM Roadmap** (Dec 18, 2025): Three security milestones defined; formal proofs and proof-size constraints target mainnet-grade security standards by end-2026.[^24]
- **Institutional Adoption Indicators**: Ethereum maintains 66% of all tokenized real-world assets on-chain, with JPMorgan Chase launching its \$100 million MONY tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum this month.[^7]
- **Solana Institutional Maturity Phase**: RWA ecosystem grew 400% YoY; on-chain metrics (100% uptime, sub-\$0.001 fees, 7% staking yields) signal infrastructure-grade positioning.[^29]

### **SECURITY INCIDENTS**

| Incident | Amount | Chain/Protocol | Status | Risk |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Bybit Hack (Lazarus) | \$1.4B ETH | Ethereum | Active laundering; bounty program ongoing | **HIGH** |
| Truebit Exploit | \$26.5M ETH | Ethereum | Suspected repeat attacker; TRU token worthless | **MEDIUM** |
| No active exchange outages reported | — | — | — | LOW |


***

### **WHAT TO WATCH (NEXT 24–72 HOURS)**

1. **Senate Agriculture Committee CLARITY Act Markup (Jan 27)**: Regulatory clarity catalyst; if passed, could unlock institutional inflows and resolve digital asset taxonomy uncertainty.
2. **Macro Sentiment & Geopolitical Risk**: Supreme Court tariff rulings and Trump administration policy shifts continue to drive risk-off positioning; monitor for sudden reacceleration of capital flight.
3. **Bitcoin Options Expiry Clusters**: Large notional concentration around \$100,000 strike; potential volatility if spot price approaches psychological levels.
4. **Ethereum Technical Validation**: Ethereum Foundation due to publish detailed zkEVM security posts in January; market reaction may pivot narrative toward scalability upside.
5. **Stablecoin Flow Persistence**: Monitor USDT/USDC for further drawdown signaling prolonged capital retrenchment; current \$310B ATH may signal liquidity ceiling amid risk-off.

***

### **CONFIDENCE & CAVEATS**

**High confidence**: All major headlines verified at primary sources (press releases, regulatory filings, official exchange announcements). Bybit and Truebit exploits confirmed via Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs, and Peckshield. Price/derivatives data cross-verified against Glassnode, CoinGlass, and Deribit feeds as of 20:00 UTC Jan 21.

**Uncertainty flags**: (1) Final USD1 issuance impact on stablecoin flows still emerging; (2) Senate agriculture committee outcome Jan 27 not certain; (3) Geopolitical headline volatility (tariff fears, war risk narratives) may drive sudden liquidation cascades outside standard technical signals.
