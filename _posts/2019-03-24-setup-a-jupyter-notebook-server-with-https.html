<h3>Introduction</h3>
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. In this post, I will demonstrate how to setup a public Jupyter Notebook Server with self-signed HTTPs.
<h3>Prerequisite</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Python3</li>
	<li>pip3</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install and Setup Jupyter Notebook</h3>
You can install Jupyter with pip3.
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip3 install jupyter
{% endhighlight %}

Beyond the default configuration settings, you can configure a rich array of options to suit your workflow. To create a jupyter_notebook_config.py file in the .jupyter directory, with all the defaults commented out, use the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
$ jupyter notebook --generate-config
{% endhighlight %}

First prepare a hashed password using the function notebook.auth.security.passwd().
{% highlight bash %}
$ python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 12 2018, 13:43:14) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from notebook.auth import passwd
>>> passwd()
Enter password: 
Verify password:
'sha1:67c9e60bb8b6:9ffede0825894254b2e042ea597d771089e11aed'
>>> exit()
{% endhighlight %}

To use SSL for encrypted communication, a self-signed certificate can be generated with openssl.
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mykey.key -out mycert.pem
{% endhighlight %}

Modify the generated configuration file.
<ol>
	<li>Copy the hashed password to c.NotebookApp.password</li>
	<li>Set the full paths to the key file and the certification file</li>
	<li>Set IP to '*' to binds on all interfaces for public server</li>
</ol>
{% highlight bash %}
$ vim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
c.NotebookApp.password = 'sha1:67c9e60bb8b6:9ffede0825894254b2e042ea597d771089e11aed'
c.NotebookApp.keyfile = '/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mykey.key'
c.NotebookApp.certfile = '/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mycert.pem'
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
{% endhighlight %}

Move to your working directory and type the following command.
{% highlight bash %}
$ jupyter notebook
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can access your Jupyter Notebook with https://ip.to.your.server:8888/. Noted that the https at the front and the default port is 8888. Since the certification is self-signed, there will be a warning from the browser. Just click on Advance and Proceed to ip.to.your.server (unsafe) and you are ready to go.
