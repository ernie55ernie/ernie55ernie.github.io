### What to Watch (Next 24–72h)

**1. US Government Fiscal \& Fed Signals**
{Medium} – Macro uncertainty persists; U.S. government shutdown ongoing, complicating Fed communication. Markets await clarity on Q4 policy pivot; any "soft" signals could reignite risk appetite. **Catalyst**: FOMC calendar, treasury auctions.[^37]

**2. Bitcoin \& Ethereum ETF Inflows/Outflows Trend**
{High} – Six-day outflow streak ended Nov 6 with net inflows; sustainability key to sustained recovery. QCP Capital warned of **feedback loop: price weakness → ETF outflows → further downside**. Watch daily flows into IBIT (Bitcoin) and ETHE/ETHA (Ethereum) for early-cycle direction.[^38]

**3. Zcash Volatility \& Pullback Risk**
{High} – ZEC RSI at **84 (overbought)**; funding rates negative; analysts warn of consolidation before next leg. Support at ascending trendline critical; break below could trigger profit-taking. **Target zones**: \$500–\$600 consolidation; upside to \$800 if support holds.[^12]

**4. Ripple RLUSD Adoption \& Mastercard Pilot Timeline**
{Medium} – RLUSD onboarding to XRP Ledger pending regulatory approvals; Mastercard credit card settlement pilot milestone could trigger enterprise flow. Monitor for go-live date confirmation in coming weeks.[^7]

**5. Tether USAT December Launch \& Stablecoin Market Dynamics**
{Medium} – USAT is intended to capture ~100M U.S. users; launch by December could shift capital flows within stablecoin complex, especially if tied to Rumble/creator ecosystem integration. Watch for announcement of live availability and initial usage metrics.
