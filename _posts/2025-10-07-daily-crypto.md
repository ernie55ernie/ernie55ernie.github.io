## Market Overview (24h)

**Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs above \$125,000** as the leading cryptocurrency continues its rally into October 2025. Trading at approximately **\$124,271** at time of writing, BTC has gained **0.34%** over the past 24 hours, with the global crypto market cap now standing at **\$4.27 trillion**, up **1.08%** daily.[^1][^2]

**Ethereum** is maintaining strong momentum at **\$4,695**, posting a **2.56%** gain over 24 hours. The ETH/BTC ratio sits around **0.0375**, indicating altcoin strength relative to Bitcoin.[^3][^4][^5]

**Derivatives markets show elevated activity** with Bitcoin futures open interest reaching unprecedented levels of approximately **\$90.7-91.59 billion** across major exchanges. CME's notional open interest climbed to a record **\$39 billion** by mid-September, underscoring decisive institutional participation. Funding rates remain predominantly positive, suggesting continued bullish sentiment.[^6][^7][^8]

**ETF flows remain the primary catalyst**, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recording **\$3.24 billion** in net inflows over the past week—the strongest seven-day period of 2025. Monday alone saw **\$1.2 billion** in inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with **\$970 million**. Historically, such \$1 billion+ inflow days have coincided with short-term Bitcoin price peaks.[^9][^10][^11]

**Stablecoin supply expansion** continues with the market cap surpassing **\$300 billion** for the first time, marking **47%** year-to-date growth. USDT maintains **58%** market share at **\$176 billion**, while USDC holds **24.5%** at **\$74 billion**.[^12][^13]
