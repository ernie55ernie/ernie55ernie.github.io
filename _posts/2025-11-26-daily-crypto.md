**Total Crypto Market Cap**: ~\$3.01T, down ~30% from \$4.28T peak in October 2025[^1][^2][^3]

**Dominant Narrative**: Extreme Fear sentiment (index: 11–20), post-correction stabilization following October's \$126K BTC peak and November's \$1.3T+ wipeout. JP Morgan notes crypto is "moving from VC-style ecosystem to tradable macro asset class."[^4][^5][^6][^1]

### Derivatives Snapshot

**Open Interest**: BTC perp OI collapsed ~20% (BTC-denominated) and ~32% (USD-denominated) since October 9, falling from ~752K BTC to ~683K BTC. Altcoin OI roughly halved from October highs.[^7][^8][^9][^10]

**Funding Rates**: Funding across top 500 assets shifted neutral-to-negative for the first time in a month—historically aligned with local bottoms when sustained. Altcoin funding particularly bearish, reflecting underperformance vs. majors.[^8][^9][^7]

**Options**: Volatility implied by options remains elevated (70–75%), with strong skew toward puts (bearish). Short-dated optionality trades several points above back-end term structure.[^7]

**Liquidations**: November has seen massive liquidation events:

- **Nov 21**: ~\$1.7–2.0B liquidated, ~396,000 traders affected, largest single-day count of 2025[^6][^11][^12]
- Largest single wipeout: \$36.7M BTC position on Hyperliquid[^11][^6]
- Total November liquidations exceed prior records[^6]


### Stablecoin Flows

- Total stablecoin supply: ~\$280–300B (record high), representing ~8% of total crypto market cap[^13][^14][^15]
- **USDT**: \$184B (63%); **USDC**: \$74–75B (25%)[^14][^15][^16]
- **Ethena's USDe**: Lost nearly half of outstanding supply since October 10 liquidation shock—TVL collapsed from \$14B to \$8.3B[^10][^17]
- ECB warns: if stablecoin supply continues current growth trajectory, market cap could approach \$2T by 2028[^14]

**Risk Level**: High — November stablecoin supply dipped for first time in months, signaling capital leaving market[^17]

## Top Headlines

### 1. **BlackRock IBIT Faces Worst Month Ever — \$2.1–2.47B Outflows** {High}

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) registered record outflows in November, including a single-day record of \$523.2M on Nov 18. Total spot BTC ETF outflows for November: **\$3.55–3.79B**, eclipsing February's previous record of \$3.56B. Despite outflows, IBIT retains ~\$87B AUM; average ETF buyer purchase price is \$90,146—currently marginally in the green.[^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^17]

### 2. **Naver to Acquire Dunamu (Upbit) in \$10.3B All-Stock Deal** {High}

Korea's internet giant Naver Financial announced acquisition of Dunamu (operator of Korea's largest crypto exchange Upbit) via stock-swap valued at ~15.1T won (\$10.3B). Exchange ratio: 1 Dunamu share = 2.54 Naver Financial shares. Shareholder vote: May 22, 2026; effective date: June 30, 2026. Combined entity aims to create ~20T won fintech powerhouse integrating AI, payments, and blockchain services.[^24][^25][^26][^27][^28][^29]

### 3. **Balancer V2 Exploited for \$120–128M Across Multiple Chains** {High}

On November 2–3, DeFi protocol Balancer suffered a sophisticated smart contract exploit targeting V2 Composable Stable Pools. Attack vector: improper access controls in `manageUserBalance` function combined with rounding error exploitation. Losses across Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum totaled \$120–128M; ~\$19M recovered within hours. Attack code reportedly contained AI-generated (vibe-coded) elements including console.log statements. Balancer TVL halved from \$442M to \$214.5M post-attack.[^30][^31][^32][^33][^34]

### 4. **Polymarket Receives CFTC Approval for Regulated U.S. Return** {Medium}

The CFTC issued an Amended Order of Designation on Nov 25, allowing Polymarket to operate as a fully regulated U.S. exchange for the first time since its 2022 ban and \$1.4M settlement. U.S. users can now trade via FCMs and traditional brokerages. Polymarket acquired QCX for \$112M in July 2025 to obtain necessary licenses. Federal DOJ and CFTC investigations closed without charges.[^35][^36][^37][^38][^39]

### 5. **SEC Chairman Atkins Outlines "Project Crypto" — Next Phase of Digital Asset Regulation** {Medium}

On November 12, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins unveiled the next phase of "Project Crypto" at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Key elements: formal token taxonomy, refined Howey application, and forthcoming "Regulation Crypto" proposal targeting tailored disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors. No-action letters issued for certain crypto token distributions (Sept 29) and crypto custody by state-chartered trust companies (Sept 30).[^40][^41][^42][^43]

### 6. **U.S. Senate Draft Crypto Market Structure Bill — CFTC Takes Lead Role** {Medium}

Senate Agriculture Committee released draft legislation putting CFTC in primary oversight role for most non-stablecoin digital assets, while SEC oversees tokenized securities and investment contracts. Bill mirrors CLARITY Act that passed House in July 2025. CFTC's Acting Chairman Pham outlined 12-month "Crypto Sprint" targeting completion by August 2026.[^41][^44][^45][^46][^47]

***

## Research & Technical Reports

### FSB Thematic Review (Oct 2025)

First comprehensive global crypto regulation assessment found regulatory implementation "incomplete, fragmented and insufficient" despite market cap surging to \$4T in August 2025. **Key finding**: Progress on CASPs outpaces stablecoin regulation.[^64][^65][^62][^63]

### Block Scholes/Bybit Derivatives Report (Nov 12)

Bearish price action since October saw perp OI fall to nearly half previous levels; altcoin funding rates persistently negative reflecting underperformance; options volatility elevated 70–75% with strong put skew.[^7]

### VanEck Bitcoin ChainCheck (Nov 18)

BTC perp OI down 20% (BTC terms), 32% (USD terms) since Oct 9; funding rate collapse partly explained by Ethena TVL drop from \$14B to \$8.3B reducing basis trade positions that artificially depress rates.[^10]

### NYDIG Market Analysis (Nov 22)

ETF outflows (\$3.55B in November), stablecoin supply decline, and algorithmic stablecoin (USDE) supply collapse signal "aggressive capital flight" rather than mere position reduction.[^17]

***

- **Vector**: Improper access controls + rounding error in batchSwap function[^32][^33][^30]

- **Impact**: Balancer TVL halved; multiple Balancer forks also affected[^31][^34]
