### Summary

This paper by **Ran Tao**, **Chris Brooks**, and **Adrian Bell**, published in 2020, explores how news sentiment is assimilated into stock prices over time, highlighting a significant divergence in how different stocks respond to news. Using unique firm-level news data spanning from 1979 to 2016, the authors distinguish between **Slowly Incorporated (SI)** and **Quickly Incorporated (QI)** news, examining their respective impacts on stock returns.

The study finds that **stocks associated with SI news exhibit higher future returns** than those aligned with QI news, yielding a **monthly abnormal return of 139 basis points**. These returns remain statistically significant after accounting for conventional risk factors and estimated trading costs. The research reveals that SI news often corresponds to **low-attention stocks**, providing a potential edge for investors.

### Key Ideas

#### Page 9, Paragraph 1

The authors describe a methodology using a **rolling regression approach** over a 36-month window to assess how well **news sentiment scores** are incorporated into **contemporaneous stock returns**. If a stock’s price does not significantly react to news sentiment, the information is deemed **slowly incorporated (SI)**. This classification helps identify when the market might **underreact to new information**, providing a basis for profitable trades.

#### Page 11, Paragraph 3

This paragraph presents **strong empirical support** for a trading strategy that capitalizes on the SI vs. QI news classification. A **long-short portfolio**—long on SI news stocks and short on QI news stocks—yields **persistent and significant abnormal returns**, even after adjusting for multiple risk models (e.g., Fama-French factors), and remains profitable after accounting for trading costs. This finding underlines the **economic viability of using news-based anomalies** for return predictability.

### Data and Fields Used

- **Source**: Dow Jones Newswire Archive (1979–2016)
- **Stock Universe**: Common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ
- **News Fields**: Sentiment scores (based on Loughran and McDonald dictionary), article length, textual complexity
- **Stock Data Fields**: Monthly returns, firm size, trading volume, media coverage, analyst coverage, Google Search Volume Index, Bloomberg AIA
- **Control Variables**: Size, Book-to-Market ratio, Momentum, Beta, Idiosyncratic Volatility, Illiquidity

### Reflection

This research offers a novel perspective on **information dissemination in financial markets**. By identifying when markets underreact to news, the paper provides a **practical framework for constructing profitable trading strategies**. It bridges insights from behavioral finance—like limited attention—and empirical asset pricing, suggesting that **market inefficiencies persist** even in the face of accessible information. The robustness of findings across time periods, sentiment measures, and transaction cost estimates underscores the **practical implications** for institutional and algorithmic traders.
