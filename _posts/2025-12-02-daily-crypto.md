## Market Overview (24h)

**Prices \& Market Cap:**
The total crypto market capitalization stands at approximately **\$3.03 trillion**, recovering 0.5% on Tuesday after Monday's sharp selloff. December opened with Bitcoin plunging to ~\$83,800–\$85,500 intraday Monday before rebounding to the **\$86,700–\$88,000** range by Tuesday. Ethereum trades near **\$2,800–\$2,810**, down from \$3,000 a week ago. Among top alts: SOL ~\$127, XRP ~\$2.01–\$2.18, BNB ~\$828–\$880, DOGE ~\$0.15, TON ~\$1.50, SUI ~\$1.38. The Crypto Fear \& Greed Index remains at **23 (Extreme Fear)**.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10]

**Derivatives Snapshot:**
Monday's liquidations totaled **\$536M–\$1B**, with ~90% from long positions; Binance, Hyperliquid, and Bybit each saw >\$160M in forced closures. XRP open interest has fallen 59% from October highs (1.7B XRP to ~0.7B XRP), with funding rates cooling to near 0.001%. BTC options open interest reached an ATH of \$65.6B in late October.[^11][^12][^13][^14]

**ETF \& Stablecoin Flows:**
U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw **net inflows of ~\$8.5M–\$70M on Dec 1**, breaking a four-week outflow streak. FBTC led with +\$67M, ARKB +\$7.4–\$84M, while IBIT saw outflows of -\$65.9M to -\$108.6M. November recorded **record ETF outflows of \$3.79B**, with BlackRock's IBIT alone seeing ~\$2.47B in redemptions. Stablecoin supply reached ~\$280B in September 2025; USDT and USDC account for 93% of the market. Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executed its first ~\$5M IBIT purchase under SB 21.[^15][^16][^17][^18][^19]

**Dominant Narrative:** Risk-off sentiment driven by Bank of Japan rate hike signals, Fed uncertainty, and heavy deleveraging following November's 21% BTC decline.[^3][^4][^6]

## Top Headlines (What \& Why It Matters)

- **S\&P Downgrades Tether (USDT) to "Weak" (Nov 26):** S\&P Global cut USDT's stability score to 5 (weak) from 4 (constrained), citing rising high-risk reserves (bitcoin, gold, secured loans) and disclosure gaps. Tether disputes the assessment, emphasizing USDT's adoption and liquidity. **Risk: Medium.** Tether remains systemically important (~\$184B supply); further rating actions could affect market confidence.[^20][^21][^22]
- **Yearn Finance yETH Exploit (~\$9M, Dec 1):** Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the yETH stableswap pool, minting ~235T yETH tokens and draining ~1,000 ETH (\$3M) routed through Tornado Cash. Yearn's V2/V3 vaults were unaffected. ~\$2.4M has been recovered. **Risk: Low-Medium.** Isolated to legacy pool; broader DeFi sentiment slightly dampened.[^23][^24][^25]
- **Balancer V2 Hack (~\$117–128M, Nov 3):** The largest DeFi exploit of 2025 exploited a rounding error in Composable Stable Pools, draining funds across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Sonic. ~\$19M recovered; TVL halved from \$442M to \$214M post-attack. **Risk: High (historical).** Underscores persistent smart contract risks in mature protocols.[^26][^27][^28][^29][^30][^31]
- **Upbit Hack (~\$30M, Nov 27):** North Korea's Lazarus Group suspected of compromising South Korea's largest exchange; funds transferred via impersonation of administrators. **Risk: Medium.** Korean regulators investigating; no direct impact on global markets yet.[^32][^33]
- **Ripple Secures Expanded MAS License (Dec 1):** MAS approved expanded payment activities for Ripple Markets APAC under its Major Payment Institution license, enabling broader token-based settlement (XRP, RLUSD) services in Singapore. **Risk: Low.** Positive for institutional adoption in APAC.[^34][^35][^36]
- **Bitnomial Launches First CFTC-Regulated Spot Crypto Trading (Dec 1):** Self-certified rules went into effect, allowing leveraged and non-leveraged spot crypto products on a federally regulated commodities exchange—a U.S. first. **Risk: Low.** Bullish for regulatory clarity; could attract institutional flow.[^37][^38][^39][^40][^41][^42]
- **Strategy Inc (MSTR) Announces \$1.44B Cash Reserve (Dec 1):** The world's largest corporate BTC holder moved to reassure investors amid the December selloff, revising its year-end BTC price guidance down from \$150K to \$85K–\$110K. **Risk: Low.** Corporate treasury hedging; no immediate market impact.[^6]
