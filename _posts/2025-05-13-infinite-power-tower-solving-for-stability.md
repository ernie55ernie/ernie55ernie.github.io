We are given a fascinating recursive expression:

\\[
x^{x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^\cdot}}}} = 2
\\]

This infinite power tower, also known as a **tetration**, asks:

> What value of \\(x\\) causes this tower to converge exactly to 2?

### Step 1: Understand the Definition

Let:

\\[
y = x^{x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^\cdot}}}}
\\]

Given that \\(y = 2\\), and because the tower is infinitely recursive:

\\[
y = x^y
\\]

### Step 2: Solve the Equation

Substitute \\(y = 2\\) into \\(y = x^y\\):

\\[
2 = x^2
\\]

Solving for \\(x\\):

\\[
x = \sqrt{2}
\\]

### Step 3: Validate Convergence

Infinite power towers don't always converge. For convergence, it’s known that:

- The tower \\(x^{x^{x^{\cdots}}}\\) converges if and only if \\(0 < x \leq e^{1/e} \approx 1.444\ldots\\)

Check if \\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142\\) is within that range — it is.

Thus, the tower **converges** and the result is valid.

## Final Answer

**\\(\boxed{x = \sqrt{2}}\\)**
