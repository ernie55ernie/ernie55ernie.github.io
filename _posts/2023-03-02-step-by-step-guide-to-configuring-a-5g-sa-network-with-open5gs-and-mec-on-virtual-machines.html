<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of telecommunications, the deployment of 5G networks represents a monumental leap
	forward, offering unprecedented speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect a multitude of devices
	simultaneously.
	At the heart of this transformation is the <a
		href="https://www.telecomtrainer.com/ngcn-next-generation-core-network/">Next Generation Core Network
		(NGCN)</a>, with Open5GS being a pivotal open-source implementation that allows for the flexible and scalable
	deployment of 5G services.
	As we delve deeper into the realm of 5G, the integration of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) emerges as a critical
	component, bringing processing power closer to the end-user and enabling a wide array of latency-sensitive and
	bandwidth-intensive applications.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will embark on a comprehensive journey to set up a Standalone (SA) 5G network using Open5GS,
	configured across three virtual machines (VMs) to simulate a real-world deployment.
	This setup not only provides a practical understanding of the intricacies involved in 5G network deployment but also
	showcases the integration of MEC, a cornerstone technology for realizing the full potential of 5G.</p>

<p>Our setup will involve the installation of <a href="https://open5gs.org/">Open5GS</a> SA on one VM to act as the core
	network, <a href="https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM">UERANSIM</a> on another VM to simulate the 5G User Equipment
	(UE) and radio access network (RAN), and a dedicated VM for the User Plane Function (UPF) configured as an MEC
	instance.
	The choice of VirtualBox as the virtualization platform offers a flexible and accessible environment for this setup,
	allowing for a detailed exploration of 5G network functions and MEC capabilities within a controlled environment.
</p>

<p>The network configuration will utilize a <a
		href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network-manager-nat-network-tab">NAT network</a>, ensuring
	that our simulated 5G network components can communicate effectively while remaining isolated from the host system's
	network, providing a secure and straightforward setup process.</p>

<p>By the end of this post, you will gain not only a theoretical understanding of 5G SA networks, Open5GS, and MEC but
	also practical insights into configuring and testing a 5G network setup. Whether you're a network enthusiast, a
	researcher, or someone keen on the practical aspects of telecommunications technology, this guide will provide you
	with the knowledge and skills to explore the cutting-edge of 5G networking.</p>

./install/bin/open5gs-amfd &
./install/bin/open5gs-ausfd &
./install/bin/open5gs-udmd &
./install/bin/open5gs-pcfd &
./install/bin/open5gs-nssfd &
./install/bin/open5gs-bsfd &
./install/bin/open5gs-udrd &
./install/bin/open5gs-mmed &
./install/bin/open5gs-sgwcd &
./install/bin/open5gs-sgwud &
./install/bin/open5gs-hssd &
./install/bin/open5gs-pcrfd &
{% endhighlight %}
		<p>The sleep commands ensure that services with dependencies have time to start up before their dependents.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>On the UPF VM (User Plane):</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Configure the network interface for the UPF by adding a new tunnel interface ogstun:
		</p>
{% highlight bash %}
sudo ip tuntap add name ogstun mode tun
sudo ip addr add 10.45.0.1/16 dev ogstun
sudo ip link set ogstun up
{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Set up IP masquerading to enable NAT for the UE's traffic going through the UPF:
		</p>
{% highlight diff %}
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.45.0.0/16 ! -o ogstun -j MASQUERADE
{% endhighlight %}
		<p>Replace the address under amfConfigs with the actual IP address of your AMF.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Run the Open5GS UPF daemon:
		</p>
{% highlight bash %}
./install/bin/open5gs-upfd
{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
</ol>
