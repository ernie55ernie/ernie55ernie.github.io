---

## Market Overview (24h)

- Bitcoin is trading around 66.9k USD with a marginal 24h pullback of about 0.3%, indicating consolidation after the early‑February selloff rather than a new leg down.[^1]
- A recent CoinMarketCap-based update pegs global crypto market cap near 2.36 trillion USD, roughly 3.5% lower over 24h at the time of that snapshot, suggesting broad but not extreme risk‑off conditions.[^2]
- Derivatives data show total futures open interest around 98.7 billion USD and 24h liquidations of about 182.8 million USD, consistent with a moderately leveraged market rather than peak euphoria.[^3]
- Perpetuals indicate a modestly long bias: BTC funding near +0.01% across major venues, with ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, SUI, BNB, OP, and ADA all showing small positive funding, signalling slightly bullish positioning.[^3]
- Among tracked majors in the derivatives tape, BNB (+6.4% 24h), SOL (+2.1%), XRP (+1.7%), DOGE (+1.4%), OP (+13.1%), and ADA (+0.3%) outperform BTC (+0.5%) and SUI (−1.2%), pointing to selective rotation into beta alts.[^3]
- Contextually, VanEck notes BTC futures open interest fell from roughly 61 billion to 49 billion in early February and more than 45% from the October 2025 peak, reinforcing a broader deleveraging backdrop.[^4]


## Top Headlines (What \& Why it matters)

- Bitcoin holding the mid‑60k area with only a −0.28% move in the last 24h and technical “golden cross” support on weekly stochastic suggests consolidation at a major support zone rather than capitulation. [Risk: Medium][^1]
- Economic Times’ CoinMarketCap roundup highlights BTC hovering near 66–68k with declining spot ETF inflows and cautious sentiment, implying macro‑driven range trading and less aggressive dip‑buying. [Risk: Medium][^2]
- VanEck’s February analysis of the recent BTC drawdown shows futures OI down over 20% week‑on‑week (61b → 49b) and about 45% from the October 2025 leverage peak, framing today’s calmer tape within a sizable prior de‑risking. [Risk: Medium][^4]
- A new security report from Bitcoinke emphasizes that social‑engineering scams drove over 60% of 2025 crypto incidents and that January 2026 scams alone stole about 370 million USD, underscoring persistent non‑technical attack vectors despite quieter price action. [Risk: Medium][^5]


## Exchanges

- Phemex announced a new Espresso (ESP) spot trading pair going live on 2026‑02‑23 at 10:00 UTC (originally also specified in UTC), expanding its listings in advance of next week’s trading. [Risk: Low][^6]


## Regulation/Law

- No material, market‑moving regulatory or enforcement updates for US, EU (MiCA), UK, Taiwan FSC, Singapore MAS, Hong Kong SFC/HKMA, or Japan FSA were identified within the last 7 days in the checked sources. [Risk: Low]


## Research/White Papers

- No clearly market‑moving new research, protocol white papers, or technical standards drafts within the last 14 days surfaced in the surveyed sources; most indexed academic work predates 2025. [Risk: Low][^7][^8][^9]


## Security Incidents

- No confirmed major hacks or protocol‑level exploits within the last 48 hours were identified in the checked feeds; recent focus remains on retrospective summaries of 2025–January 2026 incidents rather than fresh events. [Risk: Medium][^10][^5]


## What to Watch (next 24–72h)

- US macro data: Phemex flags the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on 2026‑02‑19 (no time given; typically released during the US morning, ~15:00–15:30 UTC) as a near‑term macro volatility cue for risk assets including crypto. [Risk: Medium][^6]
- On 2026‑02‑20, US Q4 GDP (second estimate) and December core PCE inflation prints are highlighted as key catalysts that could shift rate expectations and, by extension, crypto risk appetite; only dates, not times, are specified (standard BLS/Bureau releases usually land in the 13:30–15:30 UTC window). [Risk: High][^6]
- LayerZero’s scheduled unlock of about 25.71 million ZRO tokens (≈43 million USD at the referenced prices) on 2026‑02‑20 (date only, no time; treat as a calendar‑day event in UTC) may pressure ZRO and adjacent DeFi flows around the unlock. [Risk: Medium][^6]
- ETHDenver 2026, which kicked off on 2026‑02‑18 in Denver (local Mountain Time, UTC−7), is ongoing and could generate narrative‑driven volatility in Ethereum, L2, and infra tokens as announcements and demos emerge. [Risk: Medium][^6]

Confidence: Medium confidence; several key market and derivatives metrics come from a single aggregated data source and some price/regime context relies on slightly older but still relevant commentary.
