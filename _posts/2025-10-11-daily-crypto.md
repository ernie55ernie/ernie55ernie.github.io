## Market Overview (24h)

Bitcoin plunged to \$105,000 intraday before recovering to around \$111,700, marking an 8% decline following President Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Ethereum suffered even sharper losses, dropping 12-16% to approximately \$3,835-3,844. The total crypto market capitalization fell from \$4.30 trillion to \$3.74 trillion, erasing nearly \$560 billion in value.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7]

**Derivatives snapshot**: The crash triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history, with over \$19.16 billion in leveraged positions wiped out—nearly 20 times larger than the March 2020 COVID crash. Of this, approximately \$7 billion was liquidated within the first hour alone. Over 1.6 million traders faced forced liquidations, with long positions accounting for roughly \$16.7 billion of the total losses.[^3][^8][^1]

**Stablecoin flows**: TRON network experienced \$1.1 billion in stablecoin inflows over 24 hours, while the PLASMA network saw \$996 million in outflows. USDe briefly depegged to \$0.60 on Binance due to liquidation pressure from institutional cross-margin strategies.[^9][^10]
