### **Market Overview (24h)**

* **Prices:** **Bitcoin** rebounded strongly (+3–5%) to ~\$91,600, breaking a downtrend that saw it touch 7-month lows earlier in the week. **Ethereum** is trailing but volume has surged. **Sui** is a standout performer (+7%), while **Solana** faces headwinds (-23% weekly trend) following the Upbit security incident, though it is attempting to stabilize.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
* **Derivatives:** Funding rates have reset to neutral/near-zero, signaling a healthy flush of leverage. Open Interest (OI) had been unwinding, but call options at the \$100,000 strike are now seeing renewed activity on Deribit, suggesting traders are positioning for a year-end rally.[^5][^6]
* **Stablecoins:** Total stablecoin supply has expanded ~18% in Q4 to nearly \$200B, confirming sustained institutional liquidity inflows.[^7]


### **Top Headlines**

* **Upbit Hacked for \$36M (High Impact):** South Korea’s largest exchange suspended deposits and withdrawals after detecting abnormal transactions involving \$36M in Solana-based tokens. The breach occurred on the anniversary of its 2019 hack.[^8][^3]
* **Abu Dhabi Takes \$2B Binance Stake (Medium Impact):** An Abu Dhabi-backed investment group acquired a \$2B stake in **Binance**, deepening the exchange's ties to the UAE and bolstering its capital base amid global regulatory shifts.[^9]
* **Trump Media x Crypto.com ETF Pact (Medium Impact):** Trump Media announced a partnership with **Crypto.com** to launch financial products under the "Truth.Fi" brand, likely targeting retail-focused crypto ETFs.[^9]
* **Coinbase Lists BNB on Roadmap (Medium Impact):** In a rare move, **Coinbase** added rival Binance’s **BNB** token to its listing roadmap ("Blue Carpet"), signaling a potential thaw in competitive posturing or a strategic play for volume.[^10][^11]
* **Canary Capital Files for Sui ETF (Medium Impact):** Canary Capital has filed for a spot ETF tracking **Sui**, adding to the growing list of altcoin ETF applications following recent Solana and XRP filings.[^9]


### **Exchanges**

* **Binance:** Listed **APRO** on its HODLer Airdrops platform and launched USDS-margined **IRYS** perpetuals.[^12]
* **Upbit:** All withdrawals suspended indefinitely pending security review of the Solana wallet breach.[^3]
* **Coinbase:** Formally introduced "The Blue Carpet" asset listing program to streamline issuer onboarding.[^10]


### **Government / Law & Regulation**

* **United States:** The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are targeting the week of **December 8** to mark up a bipartisan market structure bill. The legislation aims to hand primary oversight of digital commodities (spot markets) to the CFTC.[^13]
* **SEC vs. Ripple:** **Ripple Labs** confirmed the SEC has ceased its appeal regarding crypto oversight, potentially closing the chapter on its multi-year securities litigation.[^9]
* **Australia:** Regulators introduced a new consumer protection framework specifically targeting crypto exchanges and custody providers.[^8]


### **Research & Technical Reports**

* **Glassnode (Week 47):** Released earlier this week, the report described Bitcoin as "fragile" in the \$81k–\$89k range with short-term holder loss ratios collapsing to 0.07x. Today’s pump to \$91k invalidates the immediate bearish breakdown scenario but confirms the "liquidity on edge" thesis where volatility strikes quickly.[^5]
* **Coinbase/Glassnode Q1 2025 Guide:** Highlights that Layer-2 scaling is now dominant (transactions +41%) and stablecoins are increasingly serving as a "liquidity layer" for institutions, not just DeFi degen trading.[^7]


### **Security Incidents**

* **Upbit Exploit:** Confirmed theft of ~\$36M in Solana ecosystem tokens. Assets were moved to unknown wallets; no reimbursement plan has been finalized yet, though the exchange has pledged to cover losses in the past.[^3][^8]


### **Social & Sentiment**

* **Sentiment:** Shifted from "Fear" to "Cautious Optimism" overnight as BTC reclaimed \$90k.
* **DOGE:** Technical analysts note a bullish higher-low structure forming, distinguishing it from other meme assets that have flagged.[^3]
* **XRP:** Narrative shifting to a "V-shaped recovery" driven by ETF approval speculation.[^3]


### **What to Watch (Next 24-72h)**

* **Upbit Post-Mortem:** Watch for resumption of withdrawals or movement of stolen funds; potential sell-pressure on SOL if hackers liquidate.
* **US Monthly Close:** Bitcoin needs to hold >\$90k into the weekend to confirm the monthly candle strength.
* **Dec 8 Regulatory Catalyst:** Market may begin pricing in the Senate markup; expect volatility in "commodity" tokens (ADA, SOL, HBAR) that would benefit from CFTC oversight.

**Confidence:** High; primary sources verified for Upbit hack, Binance stake, and Senate timeline.
**Note:** Current date treated as Nov 27, 2025.
