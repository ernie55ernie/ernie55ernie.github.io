<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Continued from the last post <a href='/travel/japan/2017/02/25/trip-to-mount-fuji.html'>Trip to Mount. Fuji - Shinjuku and the lakeside hotel</a>, we had a hearty breakfast at the hotel. Buffet at the hall was composed of so many kinds of food that we can not resist the tempatation to try all of them!</p>
<h3>Kawaguchiko</h3>
<p>Walking along the lakeside, there is a sign indicating the water level in the past.</p>

<p>Originally we were planning to take the Mt. Kachi ropeway and get to Kawaguchiko Tebjozan Park. But as we arrived at its entrance, there was a sign saying that it is repairing. What a pity!</p>

<p>Near the entrance of Mt. Kachi ropeway, we took the Lake Kawaguchi pleasure boat and enjoyed a nice view in the midst of the lake.</p>

<p>Although the ropeway was close, we still managed to find a secret pathway accessing Kawaguchiko Park.</p>

<p>On the half way, the mountain path were covered by white snow and ice and we could'n forward anymore we didn't have the appropriate equipment needed to walk on such a slippy ground.</p>

<p>Finding where to eat, we accidentally went to far.</p>

<p>Finally, we came to a tea house at the lakeside.</p>

<p>Here, risotto, curry, light meal, matcha, and sake are served. (I must say the warm sake tasted just like Chinese sorghum)</p>

<p>There were so many cute ducks!</p>

<p>Despite of the fact that it is so cold, three of us ordered lavender ice creams and it tasted quite special.</p>

<p>Strolling through the site at lakeside, we picked some branches for fun.</p>

<h3>Music Forest</h3>
<p>Just like the name suggested, Music Forest is a suitable place for hipsters.</p>

<p>Also it is really a good place to bring your female friend and they can rent out dresses for princess. Scheduled music display are introduced by a narrator (using Janapess) and played by large music boxes.</p>

<p>After a long and tiring strolling, we went back to the hotel and enjoy the fresh free beer and nice dinner.</p>

<p>As a footnote there is a small bar at the hall of this hotel, cocktail, beer, whiskey, dessert, and drinks are served. Sun rise is recommanded if you like a higher alcohol concentration.</p>
