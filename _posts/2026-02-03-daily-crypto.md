## **MARKET OVERVIEW (24H)**

**Top Market Moves – BTC, ETH, Alts**

- **Bitcoin (BTC):** Trading ~\$78,000–\$80,000 after recovering from \$75,000 support (Jan 28–29 low). 24h change: +3% overnight; YTD: -35% from October 2025 ATH (~\$125,000). Market cap: ~\$1.55T; dominance: 60% (elevated from sub-55% lows).[^1][^2]
- **Ethereum (ETH):** Bounced to ~\$2,400–\$2,500 from \$2,200 oversold level. 24h change: +5% (outpacing BTC). YTD: -52% from ~\$5,000 ATH (Oct 2025).[^2][^1]
- **Top 10 Alts under pressure:** SOL, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, TON, AVAX trading 20–40% below recent peaks. Altcoin market cap (TOTAL3): ~\$769B, reflecting capital rotation toward BTC and stables.[^3]
- **OI & Funding:** BTC futures open interest: 268k contracts (2-month low; +10k recovery in last 12h). Funding rates: neutralized to slightly negative (-0.0026% avg); reflects short-term risk-off but opportunistic re-entry.[^4][^5]
- **Liquidations:** Estimated \$2B+ in forced liquidations over recent selloff (Jan 28–Feb 2).[^5]
- **Stablecoin flows:** USDT dominance elevated; USDC in contraction mode as traders preserve capital pending macro clarity.[^2]

**Market Context:** Correction phase stemming from Jan 28–Feb 1 macro headwinds and ETF outflows. Bitcoin's hold above \$75K (weekly support) + modest ETF inflows Feb 2 (IBIT +\$142.7M, FBTC +\$153.3M) signal potential bottoming, but continued caution on Feb 3.[^6]

## **TOP HEADLINES (Major News)**

**{High Impact}**

1. **SEC & CFTC Launch "Project Crypto" – Historic Regulatory Harmonization**
On Jan 29–30, 2026, SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Chair Michael Selig announced formal Project Crypto collaboration. Agencies will sign a Memorandum of Understanding to develop unified crypto-asset taxonomy, clarify securities vs. commodities boundaries, eliminate redundant registrations, and reduce jurisdictional friction. Goal: "minimum effective dose" of regulation rather than duplicate rulebooks.[^7][^8][^9]
**Why it matters:** Addresses years of SEC/CFTC turf wars. Reduces regulatory uncertainty; likely accelerates institutional adoption and clarity on stablecoin/tokenized asset oversight.
**Risk: {Medium}** – Implementation timeline unclear; Congressional CLARITY Act still stalled but SEC moving ahead unilaterally.
2. **Bitcoin ETF Reversal – \$561.8M Inflow on Feb 2 After 4-Day Outflow Streak**
U.S. spot BTC ETFs reversed outflow trend with \$561.8M net inflow Feb 2 (led by IBIT +\$142.7M, FBTC +\$153.3M). Comes after cumulative outflows of ~\$890M over prior 5 trading days.[^6]
**Why it matters:** Institutional re-engagement signal; suggests longer-term allocation intact despite volatility. Cost basis estimate for ETF holders: ~\$87,830/BTC (well above current spot).
**Risk: {Medium}** – Reversal may be tactical; sustained inflows >\$500M/week required to confirm trend.
3. **Ethereum ETF Divergence – \$2.9M Outflow, ETHA Weakness**
ETH spot ETFs recorded \$2.9M net outflow Feb 2. BlackRock's ETHA: -\$82.1M; Grayscale ETHE: -\$14.55M. Futures OI dropped to \$27.69B (from \$29.67B prior day).[^6]
**Why it matters:** Retail/speculative disengagement. ETH underperforming despite 5% daily bounce; mixed institutional sentiment.
**Risk: {Medium}** – Continued outflows may cascade; ETH at critical support ~\$2,200.
4. **Binance & OKX Explore Tokenized US Stocks – RWA Expansion**
Binance and OKX (per The Information, late Jan) reportedly planning to launch tokenized US stocks for non-US clients, reviving a product Binance discontinued in 2021 (regulatory pressure). Goal: capture TradFi yield opportunities and diversify as crypto volumes stagnate. Tokenized stock market now ~\$912M (19% MoM growth).[^10][^11]
**Why it matters:** Exchanges pivoting to "everything app" strategy; RWA monetization of crypto rails. Competitive pressure from Robinhood (~2,000 tokenized assets, 24/5 trading in EU).
**Risk: {High}** – Regulatory rejection likely (SEC/FCA); uncertain timelines. Neither exchange confirmed yet.
5. **Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit Formally Completed**
Coinbase closed \$4–5B acquisition of Deribit (world's largest BTC/ETH options exchange). Transfer of Deribit's Dubai DFSA license included. Announced late Jan / completed by early Feb.[^12][^13]
**Why it matters:** Expands Coinbase's derivatives footprint; offshore foothold (UAE) reduces US regulatory exposure. ~\$1.2T annual Deribit volume now under Coinbase umbrella.
**Risk: {Low}** – Regulatory approval already secured (Dubai).
6. **Crypto Crime Report: Illicit Volume Hit \$158B in 2025 (+145% YoY)**
TRM Labs 2026 Crypto Crime Report: illicit activity reached \$158B in 2025, up 145% from \$64.5B in 2024. Phishing & social engineering dominated Q4 2025.[^14]
**Why it matters:** Highlights systemic security risks; may prompt stricter KYC/AML enforcement.
**Risk: {Medium}** – May accelerate regulatory crackdowns on privacy coins (Monero, etc.).

***

## **EXCHANGES: Announcements & Status**

- **Deribit (now Coinbase subsidiary):** US Yield Coin (USYC) launched as yield-bearing cross-collateral option (Hashnote-backed, reverse repo on US Treasuries, secured at Bank of NY Mellon).[^12]
- **Bybit:** Ongoing ops post-\$1.4B cold-wallet compromise (Feb 2025); implemented biometric auth for multisig signers; no new outages reported as of Feb 3.
- **OKX:** New user promotion (Feb 1–28, 2026): up to 100 USDT bonus on qualifying deposits.[^15]
- **No material listing/delisting announcements for major CEX** in 48h window (as of Feb 3 UTC).
- **Status pages (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, Deribit):** No scheduled maintenance or outages reported Feb 2–3.

**{Low Impact}**

***

## **GOVERNMENT / REGULATION & LAW**

**{High Impact}**

- **SEC-CFTC Project Crypto MOU (Announced Jan 29–30, signed Feb 2026):** Framework for unified taxonomy, shared data, coordinated enforcement on tokenized assets, leveraged crypto trading, stablecoins, and prediction markets. SEC Chair Atkins: "Fragmented regulation creates confusion, not investor protection." CFTC Chair Selig: Project Crypto is "unique opportunity to move beyond longstanding jurisdictional disputes."[^8][^7]
- **Senate Passes Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act (Jan 29, 12-11 vote):** First-ever crypto market-structure bill to clear Senate Agriculture Committee. Bill grants CFTC clear authority over "digital commodities" (BTC, ETH presumed commodities under CFTC jurisdiction, not SEC). **Status:** Requires full Senate and House votes; timeline uncertain (likely H2 2026 if any). **Impact:** If passed, would reduce SEC enforcement risk on commodity-like tokens.[^16]

**{Medium Impact}**

- **No material SEC enforcement actions or CFTC penalty announcements in 72h window.**
- **EU MiCA:** Binance reportedly filed for EU-wide MiCA license in Greece (Jan 22 filing, operational status Jan 2026 forward). No new regulatory actions from ESMA/FCA/SFC/HKMA/FSC/FSA as of Feb 3.

**Timeline uncertainty persists:** CLARITY Act likely punted into H2 2026 or 2027; SEC moving unilaterally via Project Crypto in interim.

***

## **RESEARCH & TECHNICAL REPORTS**

**{Medium Impact}**

- **21Shares: Solana 2026 Outlook (Feb 1, 2026)**
Solana network proven at scale; debate now on value capture for SOL token. Key risk: protocol captures only ~2–3% of ecosystem value. Price scenarios: bear (\$95, -23%), base (\$150, +21%), bull (\$197, +59%) depending on fee monetization, validator decentralization, and stablecoin settlement adoption.[^17]
**Key Takeaway:** SOL volatility will track institutional settlement adoption, not just TPS metrics.
- **Tatum: Blockchain Upgrades 2026 (Jan 18, 2026)**
**Solana Alpenglow** (early-to-mid 2026): full consensus/block propagation rewrite. Votor voting + Rotor propagation to reduce finality to 100–150ms (vs. 12s+ now). SIMD-0266: token program optimization (-98% resource usage).[^18]
**Impact:** Enables real-time derivatives, payments, and cross-chain atomic swaps on Solana without optimistic finality risk.
- **CertiK: January 2026 Hacks Summary**
40 incidents, \$370.3M total losses. Phishing: \$311.3M (84%; single \$284M social engineering scam). Protocol exploits: \$59.3M (Step Finance \$28.9M treasury breach; Truebit \$26.4M contract overflow).[^19]
**Signal:** Hardware wallet compromise (Trezor impersonation) largest single loss; upgrade to hardware authentication critical.

***

## **SECURITY INCIDENTS**

**{High Impact}**

- **January 2026 Phishing Spike: \$311M Stolen (4x Jan 2025 levels)**
Single incident: \$284M from hardware wallet user via social engineering (Trezor support impersonation). Funds converted to Monero (XMR) for obfuscation.[^20][^19]
**Response:** Most crypto platforms have issued hardware auth upgrade notices; exchanges enforcing biometric multisig (e.g., Bybit post-Feb 2025 hack).
- **Step Finance (Solana): \$28.9M Treasury Breach (Jan 2026)**
Treasury wallet drained via "well-known attack vector." 261,854 SOL transferred. Project initiated internal controls review.[^19]
- **Truebit Protocol: \$26.4M Exploit (Jan 9, 2026)**
Unchecked overflow vulnerability in smart contract allowed attacker to mint & withdraw TRU tokens. Token price tanked post-disclosure.[^19]
- **SwapNet: \$13.3M Liquidity Provider Hack (Jan 2026)**
DeFi protocol liquidity drained; nature of exploit unclear from available sources.[^19]

**2025 YoY Comparison:** Losses up 277% YoY (Jan 2026: \$370.3M vs. Jan 2025: ~\$98M). Most lethal vector: **phishing/social engineering** (not smart contracts). Wrench attacks up 75% YoY in 2025.[^20][^19]

**Mitigation:** Hardware wallets essential; biometric auth; isolation of cold-storage signers.

***

## **SOCIAL & SENTIMENT**

**{Medium Impact}**

- **Protocol official channels:** Solana Foundation, Arbitrum DAO, Optimism Collective posting cautiously on technical roadmaps; no major governance votes or emergency announcements as of Feb 3 UTC.
- **Exchange official X accounts:** Binance, Coinbase, OKX, Kraken reiterating security best-practices; no contentious disputes flagged.
- **Researchers (Glassnode, Messari, Kaiko, Chainalysis):** Sentiment remains constructively cautious; whale accumulation noted in ASTER, CHZ, AXS via BeInCrypto (Jan 27 report), though conviction is selective vs. broad-based.[^3]
- **No major crypto-related social/sentiment crisis or FUD spike in 48h window.**

***

## **WHAT TO WATCH (Next 24–72h)**

1. **Bitcoin Price Action at \$80K Resistance / \$75K Support (Feb 3–5)**
CLARITY bill commentary (US Congress) could drive \$82K+ rally; failure to hold \$75K could retest \$70K. Watch for RBA rate decision (Feb 3, 2:30 PM AEDT) for broader macro cues.[^1]
2. **ETF Flows Reversal Confirmation (Feb 3–5)**
If IBIT/FBTC sustains >\$300M daily inflows, bottoming narrative strengthens. If outflows resume (>\$500M/day), renewed capitulation likely.
3. **Ethereum \$2,300 Pivot (Feb 3–4)**
ETH needs to decisively break \$2,600 for altcoin recovery narrative. Failure means retest of \$2,100–\$2,200 support; ETHA outflows may accelerate.
4. **US CPI/Macro Data (if released in window) + Funding Rate Normalization**
Positive macro surprise could unlock BTC rally to \$85K–\$90K range. Watch for funding rates to turn positive and sustained (>0.01%).
5. **SEC/CFTC Project Crypto MOU Signing Ceremony (Early Feb, formal announcement expected)**
Institutional positioning may pivot on regulatory clarity optics. Positive signal likely = inflows; missed deadline or delays = retest lows.
