<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Continued from the last post <a href='/travel/japan/2017/02/15/trip-to-mount-fuji.html'>Trip to Mount. Fuji - Kawaguchiko and Music Forest</a>, we decided to get up early in the morning and see the sun rising from Mount. Fuji. While it was still 6:30, a fuzzy reflection of the mountain could be seen in the lake. While we didn't think of the sun rising from the other side of the lake instead of the hill side.</p>

<p>Sensoji Temple Kaminarimon is such a hot spot that is had been crowded from the subway station.</p>

<p>Walking through the streets nearby, there were lots of restaurants but we just couldn't make a decision. After wandering around through 5 or 6 blocks, we finally found a profound ramen shop.</p>

<p>The ramen here can be customized in the concentration of the soup, the thinckness of the noodles, the degree of spicy, green onion, and meat. Coddled eggs were served too. I also ordered a warm sake (in the little pot). It smelled like ceral (quite fragrant in fact).</p>

<h3>Tokyo Skytree</h3>
<p>From far away we could see Tokyo Skytree already. It was the few spot that we didn't use Google Map to find the way. Looking up to the tip of Tokyo Skytree, it seemed so far (about 300 meters high). A famous aquarium sits on the fifth and sixth floor.</p>

<p>We visited the department store beneath Tokyo Skytree but it is so huge that we felt tired soon. It is worth mentioning Pokemon Center is somewhere in the building. There are many merchandises including Pikachu dolls, stationeries, tablewares, towels, and arcade machines etc.</p>
