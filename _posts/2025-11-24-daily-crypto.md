## **Market Overview (24h)**

**Price Movements (UTC, Nov 24 09:18 Taipei time / Nov 24 01:18 UTC)**

Bitcoin rose 1.3% to \$86,899, recovering from Friday's \$80,600 low but still down 31.1% from its October ATH of \$126,080. Ethereum gained 1% to \$2,822, underperforming the top-10 peers. The total crypto market cap rebounded to \$3.06 trillion (+1.4% on Monday), climbing back above the psychological \$3T threshold after breaching it Friday.[^1][^2]

**Spot Performance (as of Nov 24 UTC)**:

- BTC: \$86,783–\$86,899, 24h range \$85,692–\$87,987[^3][^4]
- ETH: \$2,799–\$2,828, 24h range \$2,764–\$2,889[^5][^3]
- SOL: ~\$129–\$130 (+modest gain)[^6]
- XRP: \$2.05–\$2.07, up sharply 16.43% intraweek[^7][^8]
- BNB: \$854–\$857 (+1.43%)[^9]
- ADA: ~\$0.41[^10]

**Market Sentiment & Derivatives**

Fear & Greed Index at 12 (**extreme fear**), while Bitcoin  dominance sits at 23%, marking altcoin season territory. Open interest in BTC perpetual swaps remains depressed at ~\$9B, roughly half of pre-October levels; funding rates turned negative for SOL and XRP after earlier resilience, signaling weakened long positioning. Bitcoin  futures open interest declined 0.98% to \$58.67B; Ether futures fell 2.5% to \$32.39B, indicating speculative position unwinding. 7-day implied volatility spiked to ~60% for BTC, with inverted term structures and elevated put demand flagging continued downside hedging.[^11][^7][^6]

**Stablecoin Supply**

USDT and USDC minting surged \$11.75B in October, pushing total stablecoin supply to \$305–308 billion globally. USDT market cap reached \$176–182B (58% share), while USDC sits at \$74B (25%). Ethereum and Tron account for 64–70% of stablecoin transaction volume.[^12][^13][^14]

## **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

### **High Impact**

**1. Bitcoin ETF Hemorrhage Continues – Record November Outflows**
US spot Bitcoin  ETFs bled \$3.5B in November, nearing February's \$3.6B record and marking the product's worst month. BlackRock's IBIT alone saw \$2.2B in redemptions. Thursday (Nov 21) posted the second-largest single-day outflow since launch at \$903M–\$1.1B. Week of Nov 17–21 saw \$1.22B net outflow; ETH ETFs down \$1.79B for November. Friday Nov 22 witnessed partial reversal with \$258M inflows, breaking a 7-day streak. **Risk: High** – Sustained institutional exit pressure weighs on BTC liquidity; every \$1B outflow correlates with ~3.4% price decline per Citi estimates.[^15][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20]
*Primary sources: Bloomberg, Farside Investors, CoinDesk, SoSoValue.*[^21][^22][^16][^17][^15]

**2. \$2B+ Liquidation Wave as BTC Dropped Below \$82K**
Bitcoin  plunged to \$80,600 intraday Friday (Nov 22, ~02:00 UTC), triggering \$2B+ in liquidations across exchanges; OKX alone accounted for \$138.65M. Selling accelerated amid thinning liquidity and deepening ETF outflows. BTC has now dropped 9.2% WoW, 22% MoM. Total crypto market cap briefly dipped below \$3T for the first time since spring. **Risk: High** – Validates cascade liquidation risks; leverage remains elevated despite open interest decline.[^2][^23][^24][^1]
*Primary sources: Zerocap, 99bitcoins, Bybit/Block Scholes analytics.*[^7][^2][^6]

**3. BlackRock Moves \$345M BTC + ETH to Coinbase Prime**
On Nov 24 (~07:20 UTC), BlackRock  deposited 2,822 BTC (\$243.59M) and 36,283 ETH (\$101.72M) into Coinbase Prime, per Lookonchain on-chain data. Transaction follows week of heavy ETF outflows. **Risk: Medium** – Could signal institutional rebalancing or preparation for client redemptions; alternatively, routine custody operations. No official BlackRock statement.[^20]
*Primary sources: Binance Square (Lookonchain), TechFlow.*[^20]

**4. SGX Launches Institutional Bitcoin & Ethereum Perpetual Futures (Nov 24)**
Singapore Exchange Derivatives went live Nov 24, 08:00 UTC with Bitcoin  and Ethereum perpetual futures—the first exchange-listed, institutionally cleared perpetual contracts. Leverages MAS-supervised clearing; DBS, Galaxy Digital confirmed as liquidity partners. **Risk: Medium** – Bridges TradFi infrastructure to crypto perps; competes with Binance/CME but attracts regulated capital. Major milestone for institutional adoption in APAC.[^25][^26]
*Primary sources: SGX press release (Nov 17), TechNode, Yahoo Finance.*[^26][^25]

**5. Cardano Network Split on Nov 21 – Old Bug Exploited via AI-Generated Instructions**
Cardano  experienced a chain split Nov 21 (~UTC) when a malformed transaction triggered a 2022-vintage bug, exploited unintentionally by a stake pool operator using AI-generated code. Nodes diverged; swift patch resolved the issue by Nov 23. Charles Hoskinson confirmed no security flaw in current protocol but urged caution on AI tooling. **Risk: Medium** – Highlights AI-driven operational risks; no fund loss reported. Parallels 2013 Bitcoin  fork and 2016 Ethereum DAO incident per commentators.[^27]
*Primary sources: CoinLaw, Hoskinson X post (Nov 23).*[^27]

**6. Agentic FoF AI Agent Hacked – \$531K Drained (Nov 24)**
On-chain asset management AI agent Agentic FoF suffered a security exploit Nov 24, losing ~\$531,000; all vaults paused, withdrawals suspended pending investigation. No details on vulnerability vector disclosed. **Risk: Medium** – Underscores smart contract and AI agent security gaps in emerging DeFi infrastructure.[^28]
*Primary sources: WEEX (BlockBeats, Nov 24).*[^28]
