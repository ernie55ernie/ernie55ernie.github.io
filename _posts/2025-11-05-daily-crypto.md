## **Market Overview (24h)**

The cryptocurrency market suffered its second consecutive day of heavy selling pressure, with total market capitalization plummeting to **\$3.45 trillion**, down approximately **3.97% over 24 hours** and erasing over **\$1 trillion** since early October. Bitcoin briefly fell below the critical **\$100,000** psychological support level, touching lows near **\$99,980** to **\$103,000** (current trading: ~\$101,993 as of latest reports), representing a **-2.89% to -5.38%** 24h decline and **-9.88% weekly** drop. Ethereum plunged dramatically, sliding **-10% to -16%** in 48 hours to test **\$3,000-\$3,150**, with current levels around **\$3,306**. The market registered the **largest single-day liquidation event** in months, with **\$1.8-2.0 billion** in forced liquidations affecting **441,867-470,000 traders**; approximately **\$1.38-1.63 billion** came from long positions.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9]

### **Top Asset Performance (24h)**

- **BTC**: -2.89% to -5.38%, currently ~\$101,993-\$103,877[^5][^1]
- **ETH**: -5.24% to -10%, currently ~\$3,306-\$3,490[^4][^6][^5]
- **SOL**: -8% to -9.08%, currently ~\$156-\$159[^10][^5]
- **XRP**: -5% to -6.19%, currently ~\$2.22-\$2.26[^4][^5][^10]
- **BNB**: -7% to -7.31%, currently ~\$946-\$949[^5][^10]
- **ADA**: -6.60%, currently ~\$0.54[^5]
- **DOGE**: -5% to -6%, currently ~\$0.165-\$0.252[^10][^4]


### **Derivatives & Funding**

Funding rates eased slightly but remain elevated above **\$67 billion in total open interest**. The liquidation cascade was concentrated in **ETH** (**\$85.6M**), **BTC** (**\$74.6M**), and **SOL** (**\$35M**). Long traders accounted for nearly **90%** of losses, indicating over-leveraged bullish positions were wiped out as prices dropped **5-10%** across major assets.[^11][^8][^12][^13]

### **Stablecoin Flows**

Stablecoin inflows to Binance surged to **\$7.3 billion**, the highest level since December 2024, potentially signaling "dry powder" accumulation despite the selloff. Total stablecoin supply (USDT + USDC) stands at approximately **\$219-260 billion**, with combined market dominance around **87%**.[^14][^15][^16][^17]

## **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

### **Risk Impact: HIGH — Fifth Day of ETF Outflows Intensifies Institutional Exodus**

- **U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs** posted **\$577-578 million in net outflows** on Nov 4 (UTC), the **largest single-day redemption since August 1, 2025**. Fidelity's **FBTC** led with **-\$356.6M**, followed by **ARK/21Shares ARKB** (**-\$128M**) and **Grayscale GBTC** (**-\$48.9M**). Five-day outflow streak totals **\$1.9 billion**.[^18][^19][^20]
- **Ethereum spot ETFs** bled **\$219-273.5 million** on Nov 4, also marking the **fifth consecutive day** of withdrawals. **BlackRock's ETHA** saw the largest single-day outflow at **-\$111M**, followed by **Grayscale ETH** (**-\$68.6M**) and **Fidelity FETH** (**-\$19.8M**).[^21][^22][^23][^24][^18]
- In contrast, **Solana spot ETFs** posted modest **+\$14.83M inflows**, extending a six-day inflow streak but marking the smallest daily gain since debut.[^19][^25][^21]
- **Why it matters**: Institutional de-risking is accelerating as macro headwinds mount. The combined **\$800M+ outflow** signals a "decisive shift in institutional positioning" amid tightening liquidity and fading confidence in near-term rate cuts.[^26][^18]


### **Risk Impact: HIGH — Federal Reserve Hawkish Pivot Crushes Rate-Cut Hopes**

- **Fed Chair Jerome Powell** stated on Nov 3 that a December rate cut is **"not a foregone conclusion"**, following the Oct 25bp cut that brought the fed funds rate to **4.25-4.50%**. Fed official **Austan Goolsbee** added his threshold for December easing is **"higher than at previous meetings"**, citing persistent inflation above target for **4.5 years**.[^27][^13]
- **CME FedWatch Tool** now prices **69.3% probability** of a December cut, down sharply from prior expectations.[^13]
- **Why it matters**: Hawkish Fed rhetoric triggered the Nov 3-4 selloff, with over **\$395.7M liquidated** in 24h as traders unwound leveraged long positions. Rising **Treasury yields** and a stronger **DXY (above 100)** are driving capital rotation away from risk assets.[^26][^13][^4]


### **Risk Impact: MEDIUM — President Trump Doubles Down on U.S. Crypto Dominance Amid China Warnings**

- On Nov 3, **President Trump** warned: *"I don't want to have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto"*, reiterating his campaign pledge to make the U.S. the **"crypto capital of the world"**.[^28][^29][^1]
- Trump previously signed the **GENIUS Act** (July 2025) establishing federal stablecoin regulations and created a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** via Executive Order (March 2025).[^29][^30]
- **Why it matters**: Geopolitical crypto competition is intensifying. Trump's rhetoric aims to counter China's blockchain advances, but near-term market focus remains on macro headwinds rather than policy tailwinds.[^31][^1]


### **Risk Impact: MEDIUM — Binance Founder CZ Receives Full Pardon from Trump**

- Trump pardoned **Changpeng Zhao (CZ)**, Binance founder, who had pleaded guilty to **AML violations** and served four months in 2024. Trump later claimed *"I don't know who he is"* but said CZ was *"treated really badly by the Biden administration"*.[^32][^33][^31]
- **BNB** rallied ~**3-5%** on the week following the pardon.[^32]
- **Why it matters**: The pardon signals a **crypto-friendly regulatory environment** under Trump, potentially easing enforcement pressures on major exchanges. Critics cite conflicts of interest given Binance's involvement in Trump family crypto ventures.[^31]


### **Risk Impact: LOW — October Ended in Red for First Time Since 2018**

- Bitcoin closed October in negative territory for the **first time since 2018**, with both **whales** and **long-term holders** contributing to sell-side pressure.[^4]
- **Why it matters**: Historical precedent suggests November is typically bullish for crypto, but the current selloff and macro uncertainty cast doubt on seasonal tailwinds.[^34][^4]

## **Security Incidents — Hacks, Exploits, Scams**

### **Risk Impact: CRITICAL — Balancer V2 Exploit: \$128 Million Stolen** (Nov 3, 2025)

- **Attack Date**: Nov 3, 2025, detected early morning UTC.[^66][^67][^68]
- **Amount Stolen**: **\$120-128 million** from **V2 Composable Stable Pools**, including **6,850 OSETH**, **6,590 WETH**, **4,260 wSTETH**.[^67][^68][^69][^70][^71][^66]
- **Attack Vector**: Exploited a **rounding-down precision loss** in the Balancer Vault's token conversion calculations. Attackers chained `batchSwap` operations across hundreds of swaps, compounding tiny discrepancies into massive pool imbalances.[^69][^66][^67]
- **Affected Networks**: Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and several Balancer forks.[^69]
- **Status**:
    - Only **V2 Composable Stable Pools** affected; **V3** and other pool types remain secure.[^68][^70][^66]
    - Affected pools **paused and in recovery mode**.[^66]
    - **No funds recovered**; attacker wallet remains active.[^70][^68]
    - **Phishing campaigns** emerged post-breach, falsely claiming to offer **20% "white-hat bounty"** for fund return.[^67][^66]
- **Audits**: Balancer had undergone **11+ independent audits** since 2021, yet the rounding flaw went undetected.[^70][^67]
- **Market Impact**: **ETH** dropped **-7% to -9%** on Nov 3, briefly touching **\$3,000**. **BAL token** fell **-8%** intraday.[^72][^73][^68]
- **Why it matters**: One of the **largest DeFi exploits of 2025**, underscoring that **even heavily audited protocols** remain vulnerable to economic logic attacks. The incident highlights critical gaps in smart contract security: audits cannot replace **live monitoring** and **transaction anomaly detection**. Third hack for Balancer (2020: \$500k deflationary token exploit; 2023: \$900k boosted pool exploit).[^68][^67][^69]
- **Post-Incident**: **Berachain Foundation** halted its network and froze some stolen funds; other platforms (Gnosis, Sonic, Beefy) took similar protective measures.[^70]


### **Additional Threat Activity** (Outside 7-day window, for context)

- **SleepyDuck Malware** (Nov 1-4): Malicious VSX extension (juan-bianco.solidity-vlang v0.0.8) containing RAT appeared Nov 1; uses **Ethereum smart contract** to store C2 server addresses, evading takedowns. Targets Solidity developers; **14,000 downloads** (likely inflated).[^74]

***

## **What to Watch (Next 24-72h)**

### **Market Catalysts & Events**

1. **Nov 7 (Thu) — U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Data**: Labor market strength will influence Fed rate path. Strong data = bearish for BTC; weak data = potential bullish reaction.[^75][^76]
2. **Nov 13 (Wed) — U.S. CPI & Core CPI (October)**: Critical inflation data. Lower readings typically boost risk appetite across crypto.[^75]
3. **Nov 13 (Wed) — Potential Canary XRP ETF Launch**: If approved, could drive liquidity into XRP pairs and mark historic moment for altcoin ETFs.[^75]
4. **Early November — Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade**: Scalability and efficiency upgrade; historically attracts renewed investment.[^77][^75]
5. **Nov 4 (Mon) — THORChain Mainnet Upgrade v3.12.0**: Enhanced swaps, improved performance, Solana client support.[^76]
6. **Nov 5 (Tue) — Jupiter (JUP) AMA on Prediction Market DeFi Product**: X Spaces discussion on new product.[^76]
7. **ETF Flow Prints**: Monitor **FBTC**, **GBTC**, **ARKB**, and **ETHA** for reversal signals. Another large outflow day would reinforce de-risking; net inflows from **IBIT** could support \$100k psychological level.[^20]

### **Technical Levels to Watch**

- **BTC**: Key support at **\$96,000-\$100,000**; resistance at **\$111,000**. Break below \$100k could trigger further liquidations.[^1][^10]
- **ETH**: Support at **\$3,050-\$3,200**; resistance at **\$3,500**. RSI at **35** (nearing oversold); next support levels: **\$3,020-\$2,760**.[^2][^1]


### **Regulatory & Policy**

- **Nov 13 (Wed) — SEC Staking/ETF Decision Delay Expiration**: Ethereum staking and ETF ruling pushed to Nov 13; institutional clarity awaited.[^1]
- **Nov 20 (Wed) — CISA Linux CVE-2024-1086 Patch Deadline**: Federal agencies must patch or discontinue affected systems; ransomware exploitation ongoing.[^78]


### **Token Unlocks & Rebranding**
