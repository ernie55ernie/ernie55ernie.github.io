***

### RESEARCH & TECHNICAL REPORTS

**{Low-Medium}** | **Glassnode: "Clearing the Decks" (Week 1, 2026)**[^3]

- **Key finding:** Bitcoin's short-term holder (STH) cost basis at ~\$99.1k; recovery stalled below long-term holder profitability (STH-MVRV > 1 not yet achieved)
- Implied volatility bottomed mid-holiday; skew normalizing (traders rotating toward calls)
- **Takeaway:** Near-term price action supported by measured re-engagement, not aggressive accumulation; liquidation risk low but STH conviction weak

**{Low-Medium}** | **Messari: 2026 Crypto Theses Report (Dec 2025, still current)**[^31]

- Central thesis: Shift from speculation to "system-level integration"
- Key themes: Stablecoin integration into TradFi rails; DeAI compute monetization; predictive markets at scale (Robinhood distribution); AI agent commerce
- New framework: "Disruption Factor" for evaluating L2s/protocols (Arbitrum 70/Base 67/OP Mainnet 58; others <49 indicate early/niche status)
- **Application:** Highlights long-term structural drivers independent of near-term price action

**{Low}** | **PeckShield: December 2025 Crypto Hack Report**[^24]

- Total losses: \$76M (down 60% from \$194.2M in November)
- Composition: ~\$50M address poisoning, ~\$27.3M multisig leak; remainder from protocol exploits
- **Trend:** Volatility in monthly losses; ongoing exposure despite improvements

**{Low}** | **Bitwise Proficio Currency Depreciation ETF (Jan 2026)**[^30]

- New product: bundles BTC, gold, silver, miners; hedge against fiat debasement narrative
- Reflects institutional view of crypto as inflation hedge / dollar alternative

***

### SECURITY INCIDENTS

**{High | Confirmed, Jan 9–ongoing}** | **Truebit \$26M exploit**[^24]

- Confirmed: Smart contract pricing bug; 8,535 ETH stolen
- Status: Funds partially traced through Tornado Cash; law enforcement engaged; no remediation plan disclosed
- On-chain investigation: Clean-up operation suggests premeditation

**{Medium | Confirmed, Jan 20–21}** | **Linux Snap Store supply-chain attack**[^25]

- Confirmed: Compromised Exodus, Ledger Live, Trust Wallet packages; seed phrase phishing
- Scope: 2,520+ addresses, ~\$8.5M losses
- Mitigation: Users should verify official package sources; Snap Store has suspended affected apps

**{Low | Ongoing, no new incidents Jan 21–23}** | No major exchange breaches or protocol exploits reported in past 48h

***

### SOCIAL & SENTIMENT (Official Accounts)

**{Neutral-to-Bullish}** | Ethereum Foundation / Vitalik Buterin (X/Twitter)[^21][^22]

- Emphasis on decentralization, privacy, user sovereignty in 2026; framed as security-critical, not ideological
- Tone: Reset expectations; acknowledge past compromises; rebuild trust

**{Bullish}** | Trump (Davos, Jan 23)[^16]

- Stated commitment to CLARITY Act signing "very soon"
- Reiterated goal of US crypto leadership; signaled continuation of pro-crypto agenda

**{Neutral}** | Binance official statement (Jan 22)[^17]

- Views MiCA as "opportunity for clarity"; cooperating with Greek regulators
- Emphasizes commitment to long-term EU digital financial ecosystem growth

**{Bullish}** | BitGo official (Jan 22)[^8]

- Market debut signals institutional confidence in crypto infrastructure
- Partnership with YZi Labs / Changpeng Zhao's fund noted as vote of confidence

***

### WHAT TO WATCH (Next 24–72h & beyond)

1. **SEC–CFTC Joint Event (Jan 27, 10:00 AM ET):** Live-streamed public remarks; key announcements on harmonization roadmap expected. Market may reprice on specificity / clarity statements.
2. **Senate Agricultural Committee CLARITY Act Markup (Jan 27):** Separate review track; potential for partisan disagreement on stablecoin yield rules. Outcome signals path to full Senate floor vote.
3. **Bitcoin price action at \$84K–\$90K support zones:** Glassnode notes STH cost basis at ~\$99.1k; failure to reclaim profitability (STH-MVRV > 1) increases bear case probability. Watch order book depth at \$88.5K support.
4. **ETF flow reversal:** Current \$66M daily outflows from IBIT/ETHA routine; but if sustained multi-day exits resume, signals institutional abandonment. Mid-January \$1.7B inflow recovery established floor; loss of that confidence would be material.
5. **Binance MiCA application resolution in Greece:** Timeline unclear; but regulatory approval likely by Q2. Will unlock EU passporting and become template for other exchanges' compliance strategies.
6. **Ledger IPO roadshow (likely Q2–Q3 2026):** First pure self-custody play to go public; valuation signal (~\$4B) for hardware wallet/self-custody premium in public markets.
7. **Token unlock calendar:** Jito (JTO) 5.63% of circulating supply (~\$7.4M) expected to unlock; watch for selling pressure if market sentiment weakens.

***

### CONFIDENCE & LIMITATIONS

**High confidence:** All spot prices, ETF flows, regulatory announcements, and IPO/listing data sourced directly from official exchanges, SEC/CFTC press releases, exchange blogs, or primary news outlets (Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, Fortune, Bloomberg).

**Medium confidence:** Derivative market data (open interest, funding) is 48–72h old; real-time intraday snapshots require access to CoinGlass/Bybit/Deribit proprietary APIs (not captured here).

**Caveats:**

- Truebit exploit ongoing; final recovery amount and root-cause analysis still pending.
- CLARITY Act timing remains fluid; Senate delays may extend into spring.
- Ledger IPO not yet filed; timeline ("end of 2026") is preliminary guidance only.
