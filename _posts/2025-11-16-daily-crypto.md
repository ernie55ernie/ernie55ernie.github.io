### What to Watch (Next 72h)

1. **DevConnect Buenos Aires (Nov 17–22, 01:42 UTC kickoff today)** — Ethereum Day Nov 17; watch for app announcements, Layer 2 roadmap updates, RWA token integrations. Risk: volatility on new product debuts.[^19][^20][^21]
2. **Federal Reserve December Rate Decision Uncertainty** — Market odds now 50/50 for Dec 25bps cut (down from higher confidence); government shutdown delayed Oct labor/inflation data; Dec meeting less data-rich. Next FOMC: Dec 17–18, 2025. Risk: if no December cut signal emerges, risk-off sentiment could persist.[^36]
3. **Japan Q3 GDP Release (Nov 17, Tokyo time)** — Expected 17:00 JST (08:00 UTC); amid ¥17T stimulus speculation. Weak data could accelerate stimulus narrative; strong data may stall. Impacts yen/USD, global risk appetite. Risk: delayed macro catalysts due to US gov shutdown.[^5]
4. **Bitcoin Support Test: \$94K–\$100K Band** — Technical support zone; CME futures gap at \$110–111K unresolved. If BTC closes below \$94K, risk toward \$84K–\$83K (per analyst targets). Liquidation clusters at \$112K, \$116K–\$118K (resistance). Watch for reclaim of \$105K–\$110K zone by Nov 21.[^37][^38][^39][^7]
5. **XRPC ETF Flow Sustainability & Institutional Risk-Sentiment Shift** — Day-1 volume (\$58.6M) strong; follow daily volume & XRP liquidation clusters over next 3 days. If institutional inflows stall, XRP may retest \$2.10–\$2.00 support.

***

### Confidence Statement

**High confidence**; all primary sources (SEC/CFTC press releases, CoinDesk, CME press, FSC dockets, exchange blogs, on-chain analytics) verified. One caveat: **US government shutdown impact on Oct labor/inflation data delayed Fed signal clarity** — December rate decision less certain than pre-shutdown. XRP liquidations vs. XRPC institutional demand remain in tension; watch closely.[^36]
