<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Recently, I've spent a lot of time doing something interesting in SCCS (<a href='http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~twhsheu/index.htm'>Scientific Computing & Cardiovascular Simulation</a> Laboratory). We all have been touched by song sang by Eason, that is, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VON6EEdRB34'>Under Mount. Fuji</a>.</p>

<p>So we planned for a trip to Japan and scheduled two days at the of the mountain and other days in Tokyo!</p>
<h3>Narita Airport and Shinjuku</h3>
Taking the plane departure from Taoyuan Airport at 2 am in the midnight and arriving in Shinjuku Airport at around 5 am, it's a good time for a bowl of ramen (<a href='https://www.narita-airport.jp/en/shops/detail/miyatake_sanuki_udon'>Miyatake Sanuki Udon</a>)! There are many kinds of restaurant in the third terminal, including sushi, okonomiyaki, yakitori, hamburger etc. It's worth mentioning that the design of aisle between each terminal is quite special that there are two or three tracks directing ways. Maybe they are preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics?!

Despite of the fact that it is sunny out there, the temperature is only around zero Celsius. People on the street are wearing coats and scarf.

<p>Attending the information console in Shinjuku station, the counter inform us that there were in fact many meal choices in nearby. We had lunch at Tenya Restaurant.</p>

<p>The fried shramp and fish tasted really good with the soy sauce and some ginger flakes. On the right is the soba.</p>

<p>Near the Shinjuku station, there is also a garden.</p>

<p>Several cherry blossoms stood in the midst of the National Garden. It's a worth stopping by if you like to take a look in the botanical garden inside.</p>

<h3>At the foot of Mount. Fuji</h3>
<p>Taking the express bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko station took a trip about one or two hours. The weather here was really cold and there was ice at the corner of the road!</p>

<p>Calling the hotel from the information center to the Kawaguchiko station, they sent a shuttle bus and took four of us back to hotel. How nice!</p>

<p>We lived in a lakeside hotel with a comfortable bathhouse and dinner with good service. And most of all, the hotel serves free beer beside the bathhouse until 7 o'clock pm. But not only the service and drinks, the window of all rooms can admire the great view of Mount. Fugi!</p>

<p>Dinner is served at our room and there is a cute room attendant. When we came back from the bathhouse at the first floor, we were astonished by the well-set dinner.</p>

<p>There are around 10 dishes with delicate arrangement, including sashimi, fish soup, shabu shabu (hot pot in Japaness), rice, and strawberry pudding.</p>

<p>What a special day experiencing the nice service and leisure atomosphere in Japan. And there were still five days of trip. I can't wait to visit other places in Japan!</p>
