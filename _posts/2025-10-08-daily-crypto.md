## Market Overview (24h)

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization declined 3.2% to approximately \$4.24 trillion as of October 8, 2025. **Bitcoin** dropped 2.6% to trade around \$122,000, while **Ethereum** saw a sharper 5-6% decline to approximately \$4,475.

**Stablecoin flows** remained relatively stable with total market cap holding at \$300+ billion, though **Solana** and **BNB Chain** stablecoin supplies hit all-time highs of \$15.3B and \$13.9B respectively.[^5]
