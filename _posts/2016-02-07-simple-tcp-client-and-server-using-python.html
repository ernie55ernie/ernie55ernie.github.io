<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>There are powerful libraries and tools written in <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a>. In the core part of these libraries and tools is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html">socket module</a>. This module provides access to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">BSD socket</a> interface and avaliable on numerous platforms, Unix, Window, and Mac OS X etc. Here, I'm going to create a TCP client and TCP server to test and transfer data.</div>
<h3>TCP client</h3>
<div>
	Using a TCP client, we could test service, transfer trash data, do fuzzy tests, and execute any kinds of works. First, we use AF_INET address family, where host is representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'en.wikipedia.org' or an IPv4 address like '198.35.26.96', and SOCK_STREAM which means TCP client.<br>
	Here are a few assumptions in the below code:
	<ol>
		<li>Connection would be successful.</li>
		<li>Server would wait for client to send data first.</li>
		<li>Server would response in a short time.</li>
	</ol>
</div>
{% highlight python linenos %}
import socket
target_host = "0.0.0.0"
target_port = 27700
# create a socket connection
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# let the client connect
client.connect((target_host, target_port))
# send some data
client.send("SYN")
# get some data
response = client.recv(4096)
print response
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>TCP server</h3>
<div>To establish a TCP server, we would build a multi-threaded TCP server. After binding the listening host ip and port, specify the maximum number value of the connections made to the socket.<br>
Everytime the server accept a connection, store the socket object into client variable and create a new thread to handle this connection using the handle_client function.</div>
{% highlight python linenos %}
import socket
import threading
bind_ip = "0.0.0.0"
bind_port = 27700
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port))
server.listen(5)
print "[*] Listening on %s:%d" % (bind_ip, bind_port)
# This is the thread we handle the data from  the client
def handle_client(client_socket):
    # show the data from the client
    request = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print "[*] Received: %s" % request
    # Return a packet
    client_socket.send("ACK!")
    client_socket.close()
while True:
    client, addr = server.accept()
    print "[*] Accepted connection from: %s:%d" % (addr[0], addr[1])
    # activate the function to handle the data from client
    client_handler = threading.Thread(target = handle_client, args=(client,))
    client_handler.start()
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Demonstration</h3>
<div>Execute the server and then execute the client in another terminal window. This is the output in the server window.</div>
{% highlight shell %}
python tcp_server.py 
[*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:27700
[*] Accepted connection from: 127.0.0.1:50061
[*] Received: SYN
{% endhighlight %}
<div>This is the output in the output in the client window.</div>
{% highlight shell %}
python tcp_client.py 
ACK!
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div>It's quite easy but powerful to write these TCP connections in Python. Afterward, there would be more extension of these applications.</div>
