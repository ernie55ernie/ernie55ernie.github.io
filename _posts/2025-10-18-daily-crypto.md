title: "Daily Crypto Market Brief - Crypto Slips; Shorts Crowded, ETF Outflows"
date: 2025-10-18
category: crpyto
---

## **Market Overview (24h)**

Bitcoin and Ethereum retreated from recent highs, with BTC trading at \$106,444 (-1.51% from yesterday) and ETH at \$3,831 (-1.52%), continuing the correction from October's peak above \$126,000. The total crypto market cap sits at approximately \$3.6 trillion, down from recent highs but still showing resilience after last week's massive liquidation event.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Derivatives markets show stress with funding rates hitting 3-year lows, indicating heavy short positioning across perpetual contracts. However, this extreme reset may set up conditions for a potential short squeeze if momentum shifts. Major altcoins including XRP (\$2.36), SOL, and BNB are consolidating within trading ranges as traders assess the next directional move.[^5][^6]

## **Top Headlines**

- **Record \$2 billion crypto theft by North Korean hackers in 2025** - Elliptic reports North Korean state actors have stolen over \$2 billion in cryptocurrency during the first nine months of 2025, marking an annual record. The majority of attacks were conducted through social engineering rather than infrastructure vulnerabilities. *Risk: High*[^7][^8]
- **Coinbase adds rival Binance's BNB to listing roadmap** - In a surprising move, Coinbase announced BNB's inclusion on its official listing roadmap on October 15, marking the first time the U.S. exchange has shown support for its competitor's flagship asset. Trading will begin once market-making support and technical infrastructure are established. *Risk: Medium*[^9][^10]
- **California bans forced liquidation of unclaimed Bitcoin and Ethereum** - Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 822, making California the first U.S. state to prohibit forced liquidation of unclaimed cryptocurrency, requiring assets to be held in original form rather than converted to cash. *Risk: Low*[^11]
- **Bitcoin ETF outflows exceed \$1.2 billion amid price correction** - U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over \$1.2 billion in outflows this week, with BlackRock's IBIT losing \$268.6 million on Friday alone as BTC dropped below \$104,000. *Risk: High*[^12][^13]


## **Exchanges**

- **Binance faces \$2.41 billion in liquidations during market crash** - During October's record \$20 billion liquidation event, Binance accounted for \$2.41 billion in forced liquidations, behind Hyperliquid's \$10.31 billion and Bybit's \$4.65 billion.[^14]
- **Crypto.com CEO calls for exchange probe** - CEO Kris Marszalek urged regulators to investigate whether certain platforms halted trading or mispriced assets during the recent crash that wiped out \$20 billion in leveraged positions.[^14]
- **Coinbase launches stablecoin payments platform** - The exchange introduced Coinbase Business, a financial platform for small and midsize firms to manage crypto payments and earn up to 4.1% APY on USDC holdings.[^14]


## **Regulation/Law**

- **G20 watchdog warns of "significant gaps" in global crypto rules** - The Financial Stability Board identified substantial inconsistencies in countries' attempts to regulate crypto markets, potentially harming financial stability. The warning comes as regulatory frameworks remain fragmented globally.[^15][^16]
- **SEC prepares innovation exemption rule by early 2026** - Chairman Paul Atkins announced plans for formal rulemaking to provide "innovation exemptions" for firms using cryptoassets and blockchain technology, marking a shift toward more permissive regulation.[^17]
- **European Commission defends MiCA stablecoin framework** - The EC stated existing MiCA regulations adequately address stablecoin risks, rejecting ECB calls for additional restrictions on multi-issuance stablecoin models.[^18]
- **EU authorities issue consumer crypto warning** - The European Supervisory Authorities warned consumers about crypto-asset risks and limited legal protections, emphasizing that safeguards may vary depending on asset types and service providers.[^19]


## **Research/White Papers**

- **Binance Research highlights Q3 2025 market trends** - BNB led September performance with 19.7% gains as total crypto market cap rose 4.3%. DeFi TVL increased 3% month-over-month while NFT trading volume declined 25.5%.[^20]
- **CME crypto derivatives hit \$900 billion in Q3 2025** - CME Group recorded unprecedented trading volume with average daily open interest reaching \$31.3 billion. Ethereum futures volume surged 355% year-over-year while new Solana and XRP futures achieved significant milestones.[^21]


## **Security Incidents**

- **North Korean hackers adopt blockchain-based malware delivery** - UNC5342, a Pyongyang-backed group, began using EtherHiding technique to store malicious code in smart contracts on Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, making takedowns nearly impossible.[^22]
- **German-Bulgarian authorities seize 1,406 fake crypto websites** - Officials shut down fraudulent trading platforms that disappeared with user funds, recording over 866,000 access attempts in ten days following the seizure.[^23]


## **What to Watch (Next 24-72h)**

- **Bitcoin options expiry pressure** - Approximately \$4.8 billion in Bitcoin options contracts expire today, with max pain at \$117,000 potentially creating downward pressure on prices.[^24][^25]
- **XRP ETF decision deadline** - Six major spot XRP ETF applications from Grayscale, Bitwise, and others face SEC rulings between October 18-25, which could unlock \$4-8 billion in institutional inflows.[^26][^27]
- **Federal Reserve rate decision outlook** - Market participants expect a 0.25% rate cut on October 29, which could serve as a positive catalyst for risk assets including crypto.[^28]
- **Ethereum Fusaka upgrade preparation** - Testnets continue throughout October ahead of mainnet deployment by early December, introducing PeerDAS and higher gas limits to enhance scalability.[^29]
- **Stablecoin supply monitoring** - USDT and USDC supply changes remain critical indicators of institutional money flows, with both stablecoins maintaining 88.5% combined market share.[^30][^31]

**High confidence; all items verified at primary sources or reputable secondary sources.**
