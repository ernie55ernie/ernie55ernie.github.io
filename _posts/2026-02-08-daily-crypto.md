title: "Daily Crypto Market Brief - Bear-Market Bounce Amid China Crackdown and ETF Outflows"
date: 2026-02-08
category: crpyto
---

Market Overview (24h)

- Spot: BTC trades around 71.4k USD, up ~3.3% over 24h; ETH ~2.13k (+4.4%); SOL ~88.4 (+2.6%); BNB ~644 (+0.9%); XRP ~1.46 (+3.5%); DOGE ~0.098 (+1.9%); ADA ~0.27 (+1.3%); AVAX ~9.25 (+1.4%); TON ~1.41 (+2.2%); SUI ~1.00 (+0.4%); ARB ~0.12 (+0.4%), per CoinGecko live data as of ~2026‑02‑08 13:30 UTC.  Risk: Medium (bear-market rally within broader downtrend).[^1]
- Total crypto market cap is about 2.40T USD, roughly +2.1% vs the prior day, per TradingView’s global crypto cap index. Risk: Medium.[^2]
- Derivatives: CoinGlass shows total futures open interest around 62.3B USD (+1.25% 24h), futures volume ~118.1B (‑38% 24h), and 24h liquidations ~90.8M (‑75% vs prior day), indicating reduced forced unwinds after earlier deleveraging. BTC-specific OI is near 47B USD on major venues. Risk: Medium.[^3][^4]
- Funding: BTC perps funding is near flat to slightly positive, with Binance BTC/USDT around +0.01%/8h and OKX mixed slightly negative, suggesting marginal long bias but no extreme leverage. Risk: Low–Medium.[^4]
- ETFs/flows: US spot BTC ETFs saw net outflows of ~297M USD on Feb 5 and ~635M USD on Feb 4, led by IBIT and GBTC redemptions, after large inflows on Feb 2. Recent commentary notes a 272M USD single-session net outflow with rotation into ETH, XRP and SOL ETFs rather than full exit from crypto exposure. Risk: Medium (flows now dampening, not supporting, price).[^5][^6]
- Narrative: On-chain and ETF data point to a “bears in control” phase: realized losses rising, spot demand weak, futures deleveraging, and options skew bidding for downside protection. Risk: Medium–High (further drawdown possible if spot demand does not return).[^7]

Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)

- China tightens virtual-currency crackdown, bans unauthorised offshore yuan-pegged stablecoins, and will strictly vet offshore tokens backed by Chinese onshore assets, via a joint PBoC/agency notice (Feb 6 Beijing time). This both reinforces the domestic ban on crypto and begins to formalize a regulatory lane for RWA tokenisation tied to Chinese assets. Risk: High for RMB‑stablecoins/RWA with China nexus; Medium for broader market sentiment.[^8][^9]
- Bithumb “fat finger”: Korean exchange Bithumb accidentally credited users with ~620,000 BTC due to a system error, briefly causing abnormal prices; the platform reversed transactions and is working with regulators and customers to resolve, per Reuters/ABC and local reports. Operational risk incident rather than a protocol failure, but it highlights infrastructure fragility during high volatility. Risk: Medium (localized to Bithumb/ KR market microstructure).[^10][^11]
- Thailand’s Bitkub to end web-based withdrawals after a user lost over 1M THB via a compromised computer; mobile app withdrawals remain, pending security review. This is a user compromise case, but exchange UX/security practices are under scrutiny. Risk: Low–Medium (UX/security optics, Thailand retail).[^12]
- Solana DeFi: Step Finance treasury hack (Jan 31) remains a key overhang—attackers stole ~261,854 SOL (27–30M USD) from treasury/fee wallets; STEP token dropped ~80–90% and remains distressed while investigation continues. Impact is concentrated in STEP/Solana DeFi trust rather than core Solana L1. Risk: Medium.[^13][^14]
- Cross-chain risk: CrossCurve bridge suffered a ~3M USD exploit on Jan 31–Feb 1 via a fabricated cross-chain message/`expressExecute` vulnerability in its Axelar receiver, draining PortalV2 liquidity across chains. Bridge contracts are paused; mirrors Nomad‑style message‑validation flaws. Risk: Medium–High for cross-chain/bridge names until more details and patches are in.[^15][^16]
- Macro/flows: Recent analysis of ETF and on-chain flows shows BTC sliding back into mid‑60ks with a sharp 11–13% single-day drop and about 272M USD ETF net outflows in one session, while ETH, XRP and SOL ETFs saw modest net inflows, suggesting intra‑crypto rotation not full de‑risking. Risk: Medium.[^6]

Exchanges

- Binance (global):
    - Binance Futures launching new USDⓈ‑M perps on TradFi names (e.g., CRCLUSDT, COINUSDT, PLTRUSDT) with up to 10x leverage on Feb 9 at 15:00 UTC, expanding its equity‑perp product set.[^17]
    - New USDⓈ‑M TRIAUSDT perpetual was listed Feb 6.[^17]
    - Spot: multiple low‑liquidity pairs (including various BTC/FDUSD, ETH/FDUSD and alt/BTC pairs) were delisted Feb 6 at 08:00 UTC after periodic review.[^17]
    - Futures: RVVUSDT and YALAUSDT perps will be auto‑settled and delisted on Feb 10 at 09:00 UTC.[^17]
Risk: Low (standard product rotation, but relevant for perps/alt liquidity).
- Binance TH (Thailand): local arm announced removal of additional spot pairs on Feb 6, and separate delistings (e.g., ACA, CHESS, DATA, GHST, NKN) flagged for February; details are Thailand‑specific. Risk: Low–Medium for Thai alt liquidity.[^18]
- Kraken: Official status page shows no incidents reported on Feb 6–7; recent history notes only a narrow issue with Stacks (STX) funding gateway earlier in Feb, now resolved. Risk: Low.[^19][^20]
- Coinbase: Media recaps continue to circulate about Coinbase’s 2026 roadmap (“Everything Exchange”) to integrate crypto, equities, commodities, and prediction markets in a single multi‑asset platform, with emphasis on automation and on‑chain infra via Base. Structural, not immediate‑flow news. Risk: Low (strategic, multi‑year).[^21][^22]

Regulation / Law

- China: The Feb 6 joint statement by PBoC and six other agencies restates that virtual‑currency business remains illegal, bans unauthorised offshore issuance of RMB‑pegged stablecoins, and requires strict vetting of offshore tokens backed by onshore Chinese assets. It simultaneously signals a willingness to regulate RWA tokenisation tied to Chinese assets rather than ban it outright. Risk: High for RMB‑stablecoins and CN‑linked RWA; Medium for global sentiment.[^9][^23]
- US SEC – tokenized securities guidance: On Jan 28 the SEC’s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Investment Management, and Trading & Markets issued a joint staff statement clarifying how federal securities laws apply to “tokenized securities” (security tokens and tokenized traditional instruments), including expectations for registration, disclosure, and treatment of security‑based swaps. This is staff guidance, not new rulemaking, but it gives tokenization projects a clearer compliance roadmap. Risk: Medium (structural for RWA/security‑token projects).[^24][^25]
- US SEC – American CryptoFed case dismissed: In a Feb 2 order (Release No. 33‑11407), the SEC dismissed long‑running administrative proceedings regarding American CryptoFed DAO’s 2021 Form 10 and Form S‑1 to register Ducat (stable) and Locke (governance) tokens, after the issuer sought to withdraw both filings. The Commission did not opine on whether the tokens are securities, effectively treating the matter as moot. Risk: Low (cleanup of legacy case; slight signaling that SEC is willing to step back from some contested crypto registrations).[^26][^27]
- SEC Crypto Task Force / process: The SEC’s Crypto@SEC portal now lists the Jan 28 Tokenized Securities statement and recent no‑action letters and FAQs as part of its formal crypto regulatory workstream, and on Feb 4 updated its “Crypto Task Force Written Input” page to record institutional feedback (e.g., Crypto Council for Innovation, Superstate) on Project Crypto. Risk: Low (procedural but supports the “normalisation/clarity” narrative).[^25][^28]

Research / White Papers (last ~14 days or clearly in play)

- TRM Labs – 2026 Crypto Crime Report (coverage ongoing): TRM estimates wallets linked to illicit activity received ~158B USD in 2025, up sharply from 64.5B in 2024, though illicit activity is still a low share of total crypto volume. Growth is driven by sanctions‑related flows (notably Russia‑linked networks), state‑sponsored hacks, and improved attribution via tools like TRM’s Beacon Network. Risk: Medium (regulatory and bank‑compliance pressure, especially around sanctions and stablecoins).[^29][^30]
- Glassnode – “Bears In Control” (Week On‑Chain, Feb 3): Glassnode highlights accelerating realized losses, weak spot demand, futures deleveraging, and options markets heavily skewed toward downside protection, arguing the current phase resembles early‑2022’s transition into a deeper bear regime. It stresses that without renewed spot inflows (ETFs/treasuries), any rallies are likely corrective. Risk: Medium–High (reinforces bear‑phase thesis).[^7]
- Messari “Crypto Theses 2026” (re‑summarised Feb 7 in Asian media): Messari reiterates a thesis of crypto shifting from speculation to system‑level integration, with cryptomoney (BTC, select L1s), DeFi, AI, DePIN and TradFi integration as key multi‑year themes. Older initial release, but still shaping institutional narratives. Risk: Low (structural positioning, not near‑term flow).[^31]

Security Incidents

- Step Finance (Solana) treasury compromise (~27–30M USD in SOL, Jan 31): Attackers obtained control of several Step treasury/fee wallets, unstaking and draining ~261,854 SOL; STEP token collapsed 80–90%. Team has said user positions are unaffected and is working with security firms; details on key management failures remain sparse. Risk: High for STEP; Medium for Solana DeFi perception (treasury/key‑management risk vs protocol bug).[^14][^13]
- CrossCurve bridge exploit (~3M USD, Jan 31–Feb 1): A fabricated‑message vulnerability in the ReceiverAxelar `expressExecute` path allowed attackers to bypass gateway validation and drain ~3M USD from PortalV2 contracts across chains; bridge interactions are paused and LPs told to withdraw. Protocol is offering a bounty and threatening legal action. Risk: Medium–High for cross‑chain bridge and Axelar‑integrated projects.[^16][^32][^33][^15]
- Broader hack context (DeFi): Recent months also saw the Truebit exploit (~26.5M USD ETH drained via pricing‑logic flaw) and Makina (~4M USD via flash‑loan manipulation), and TRM/Chainalysis tracking >2–3B USD in 2025 hacks. While older than 7 days, they frame current risk: cross‑chain and oracle/AMM logic remain primary attack surfaces. Risk: Medium.[^34][^35][^29]
- Social engineering / account takeovers:
    - Arbitrum DAO’s official governance X account (@arbitrumdao_gov) was compromised on Feb 3, pushing phishing links to a fake airdrop site (gov‑arbitrum[.]com); Arbitrum issued urgent alerts, confirmed no on‑chain/treasury impact, and later regained control.[^36][^37][^38]
    - The same wave of social‑media compromises has hit other major projects (e.g., BNB Chain in late 2025), with security researchers pointing to growing sophistication of phishing and SIM‑swap style attacks.[^38][^39]
Risk: Medium (user‑level loss and brand risk, not protocol‑level failures).

Social & Sentiment

- Arbitrum hack fallout: The Arbitrum DAO X compromise is heavily discussed across crypto media and X, but follow‑up coverage stresses that contracts/treasury are safe; ARB price impact has been limited, framing this as a communications‑channel issue rather than protocol risk. Sentiment: wary of social‑engineering, but no structural loss of confidence in Arbitrum itself. Risk: Medium.[^40][^41]
- Exchange/protocol messaging: Binance’s “Top Stories of the Day” digest (Feb 7) highlights mixed macro data, advancing regulation, and potential sentiment turning points as markets attempt a rebound, with ETH and BNB singled out as notable movers. Tone from majors is cautiously constructive but acknowledges volatility and regulatory overhang. Risk: Medium.[^42]
- On‑chain/derivatives views: Glassnode and other on‑chain analysts frame the current tape as a deleveraging + demand‑vacuum environment rather than a completed capitulation, with options flows still skewed toward downside hedging. Coinalyze data show OP as a notable outperformer (+13% price, +31% OI in 24h), suggesting select L2 narratives are attracting speculative flows despite broad risk‑off. Risk: Medium–High (fragile rallies vulnerable to further deleveraging).[^43][^7]

What to Watch (next 24–72h)

- Regulatory digestion of China’s new notice: Any follow‑up clarification or local‑government implementation around RMB‑stablecoins and RWA tokens, plus market reaction in CN‑narrative tokens and RWA projects with China exposure.[^9]
- US ETF flows in coming sessions: Whether spot BTC ETF net flows remain negative or stabilize/turn positive after the recent ~300–600M USD daily outflows; watch IBIT, FBTC, ARKB and BITB prints for confirmation of continued de‑risking vs rotation.[^5][^6]
- Derivatives positioning: If CoinGlass‑tracked OI and liquidations continue to cool (OI stable, low liquidations) while funding stays near flat, that supports a “low‑leverage grind”; renewed spikes in OI and liquidations would signal another volatility leg.[^4]
- Binance product changes: Impact of Feb 9 equity‑perp launches (CRCLUSDT, COINUSDT, PLTRUSDT) and Feb 10 RVVUSDT/YALAUSDT perp delistings on cross‑asset positioning and liquidity, particularly for traders using Binance for both crypto and equity proxies.[^17]
- Security follow‑through: Additional disclosures, recovery plans, or governance actions from Step Finance and CrossCurve, and whether more Axelar‑integrated bridges or Solana DeFi projects report related issues.[^13][^15]

Confidence: High confidence; all items sourced from primary regulatory/exchange/protocol documents or well‑established secondary research/news, with cross‑checks where data providers disagree.
