### **Top Headlines**

**1. Hong Kong Approves First Spot Solana ETF – Trading Oct 27** {High}
The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved Asia's first spot Solana ETF on Oct 22, 2025, managed by ChinaAMC, set to begin trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Oct 27 under tickers 03460 (HKD), 83460 (CNY), and 9460 (USD). The ETF is fully backed by physical SOL with a minimum investment of ~\$100 USD. Hong Kong now offers spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, and SOL, positioning itself ahead of the U.S., where the SEC has not yet approved a Solana ETF due to a government shutdown limiting regulatory capacity. JPMorgan estimates Solana ETFs could attract ~\$1.5 billion in their first year. Solana price rose ~6% intraday from under \$180 to \$192 following the announcement.[^12][^13][^14][^15]

**2. Trump Nominates Michael Selig as CFTC Chair** {High}
President Donald Trump nominated Michael Selig, a pro-crypto counsel previously at the SEC, as CFTC Chair on Oct 25, 2025. Selig's selection follows resistance to earlier nominee Brian Quintenz from MAGA donors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham stated the agency aims to introduce "listed spot crypto trading and tokenized collateral" by end of 2025. SEC Chair Paul Atkins confirmed the SEC is pursuing "Project Crypto," including an innovation exemption and safe-harbor framework for token issuers before year-end, though progress is slowed by the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Sept 30, 2025.[^16][^17][^18][^19][^5]

**4. October Liquidation Event: \$19 Billion Wiped in Single Day** {High}
On Oct 11, 2025 (Friday), the crypto market endured its largest liquidation event in history, with over \$19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated—nine times larger than the February 2025 crash and 19 times larger than the March 2020 FTX collapse. Bitcoin plunged over 14% from a Friday high of \$122,574 to a low of \$104,783, erasing \$380 billion in market cap within hours. Ethereum fell over 10% to \$3,514. The sell-off was triggered by President Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls late Friday, Oct 10. Hyperliquid saw 88% of losses from overextended long positions with leverage ratios up to 100x. BTC recovered to \$115,718 by the weekend as Trump downplayed trade tensions.[^25][^26][^27]

**5. North Korea-Linked Hackers Steal Over \$2 Billion in 2025** {High}
Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic reported on Oct 7, 2025, that North Korea-linked hackers have stolen over \$2 billion in cryptocurrency in 2025, nearly triple last year's total and bringing cumulative DPRK crypto theft to over \$6 billion. The majority of 2025 hacks involved social engineering attacks targeting high-net-worth individuals rather than technical exploits. Notable incidents include a \$21 million hack of Hyperliquid and Hyperdrive in October, and an alleged \$21 million hack of SBI Crypto on Sept 24, 2025. Laundering techniques have grown more sophisticated, including multiple cross-chain bridging, obscure blockchain usage, and exploitation of refund addresses.[^28][^29][^30]

**6. Russia Greenlights Crypto for Cross-Border Payments** {Medium}
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed on Oct 24, 2025, that Russia officially backs the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments, marking a major shift in financial strategy to circumvent sanctions. The Finance Ministry and Central Bank will develop clear rules to monitor transactions and prevent misuse while maintaining oversight. With sanctions limiting Russia's access to global networks like SWIFT, crypto is positioned as a practical tool for settling international trade deals.[^18][^16]

**United States**

The SEC's Spring 2025 Regulatory Agenda (released Sept 4, 2025) contemplates multiple crypto-related rulemakings covering offer/sale of digital assets, custody modernization, transfer agent rules for DLT, and dealer definitions. However, the ongoing federal government shutdown (since Sept 30, 2025) has sharply limited the SEC's ability to advance proposals.[^41][^42][^43][^17][^18]
