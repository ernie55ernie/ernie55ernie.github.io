### **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

**JPMorgan to Accept Bitcoin & Ethereum as Loan Collateral by Year-End (High Risk)**
JPMorgan Chase will allow institutional clients to pledge BTC and ETH as collateral for loans globally before Dec 31, 2025 (announced Oct 23–24, 09:00–11:00 UTC). Third-party custodians will safeguard assets. This extends JPMorgan's June 2025 policy accepting crypto ETFs as collateral. CEO Jamie Dimon previously called Bitcoin a "hyped-up fraud"; this marks a major symbolic shift integrating crypto into Wall Street's core lending infrastructure. **Why it matters:** Signals mainstream TradFi acceptance of digital assets as legitimate financial collateral; could catalyze similar moves by Morgan Stanley, State Street, Fidelity.[^17][^18][^19][^20]
**Sources:** Bloomberg (primary); CoinDesk, FXStreet (Oct 23–24, 2025)[^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^17]

**Trump Pardons Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao (High Risk)**
US President Donald Trump granted a full pardon to Binance co-founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao on Oct 23, 2025. CZ pleaded guilty in Nov 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, served 4 months in 2024, paid \$50M personally (Binance paid \$4.3B). White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated CZ was "prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency". Trump said pardon was "at the request of a lot of very good people" and that CZ had "a lot of support". CZ posted on X: "Make America the Capital of Crypto". BNB surged 6.7% (1,083→1,160 USDT) immediately post-announcement, settled +4% 24h later. **Why it matters:** Clears path for CZ to return to Binance leadership; raises conflict-of-interest concerns given CZ's support for Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial; signals crypto-friendly Trump administration policy.[^23][^24][^25][^26][^27][^28]

**Perpetual DEX Volume Surpasses \$1 Trillion in October – New Record (Medium Risk)**

Hyperliquid led with \$317.6B; Lighter \$255.4B; Aster \$177.6B. Peak single-day volume: \$78B on Oct 10 (the day of the \$19B+ liquidation event). **Why it matters:** Demonstrates DeFi perps are closing gap with CEXs; validates permissionless high-leverage markets; Oct 10 crash tested DeFi infrastructure (which handled volumes without major outages).[^3][^29][^30][^31][^32]

ETH futures OI hit record 48,600 contracts; SOL 20,700; XRP 10,100 (all ATHs). CME attributes surge to institutional shift from offshore platforms post-liquidations. CME also announced plans for **24/7 crypto futures trading** starting early 2026 (pending regulatory review). **Why it matters:** Regulated US derivatives markets gaining share from offshore; institutions seeking safety post-volatility; 24/7 trading aligns CME with crypto-native markets.[^33][^34]
**Sources:** CME Group (official); CoinDesk, FOW (Oct 22–23, 2025)[^34][^33]

Ethereum ETFs saw +\$141.66M inflows (Oct 21), led by Fidelity's FETH (+\$59.07M). **Why it matters:** Reversal signals renewed institutional conviction after liquidation-driven selloff; supports BTC defense of \$108K level.[^35][^36][^37][^38]

Japan's Financial Services Agency is mulling reform to permit banks to acquire, hold, and trade cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) as investment assets, similar to stocks and bonds (announced Oct 19–21, 2025). FSA also considering registering banking groups as "cryptocurrency exchange operators". Working group meeting of Financial Services Council to discuss proposal. Reverses 2020 guideline barring banks from crypto investment. **Why it matters:** Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio (240%) may drive investors to crypto as escape valve; regulatory shift could boost institutional adoption in Asia-Pacific's top crypto adoption market (Chainalysis).[^39][^40][^41][^42]
**Sources:** Yomiuri (primary); Bloomberg Law, Reuters, CoinDesk (Oct 19–21, 2025, 23:59–06:59 UTC)[^40][^41][^42][^39]

**SEC & CFTC Targeting Crypto Regulatory Milestones by Year-End Amid Gov Shutdown (Medium Risk)**
SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced both agencies aim to complete "cryptocurrency regulatory milestones" by Dec 31, 2025 (statements Oct 22–23). CFTC focusing on "spot crypto trading and tokenized collateral"; SEC advancing "Project Crypto" (innovation exemptions, safe-harbor framework). However, federal government shutdown (since Sept 30, 2025) has limited SEC staff progress. CFTC Acting Chair Pham posted on X (Oct 22) targeting "listed spot crypto trading and tokenized collateral by end of 2025". **Why it matters:** Potential for clear US regulatory framework before 2026; shutdown delays may push deadlines; markets watching for innovation exemptions and CFTC spot market authority.[^43][^44][^45]
**Sources:** SEC, CFTC (official statements); WorldCoinIndex, ChainCatcher, FameEX (Oct 22–23, 2025)[^44][^45][^43]

**155 Crypto ETF Applications Pending SEC Approval (Low Risk)**

Leveraged and staking products emerging as new trend. **Why it matters:** Pipeline suggests sustained institutional demand; potential approval wave could drive capital rotation into alts.[^45]

***

### **What to Watch (Next 24–72h)**

- **Deribit options expiry (Oct 25):** \$23B in BTC and ETH options expiring Friday; heavy concentration at <\$95K puts and >\$140K calls may drive price action.[^57]
- **WazirX trading resumes (Oct 24):** Indian exchange reopening after \$230M hack; watch for liquidity and user sentiment.[^80]
