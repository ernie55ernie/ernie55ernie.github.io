title: "The Meeting Problem: Will They Overlap?"

### The Setup

Two people (say, bankers) independently arrive at a train station at a time **uniformly at random** between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM. Upon arrival, each waits **exactly 5 minutes** before departing.

**Question:** What is the probability that their waiting intervals **overlap** so that they actually meet?

---

## Visualizing the Problem

Let:

- \\( X \\): arrival time of person A (in minutes after 5:00 AM)
- \\( Y \\): arrival time of person B (also in minutes after 5:00 AM)

Each variable \\( X, Y \\) is uniformly distributed on the interval \\( [0, 60] \\).

They **meet** if their arrival times are within 5 minutes of each other:

\\[
|X - Y| \leq 5
\\]

---

## Geometric Probability Approach

We represent all possible arrival pairs \\( (X, Y) \\) as points in the 60Ã—60 square.

The region where \\( |X - Y| \leq 5 \\) forms a band of width 10 along the diagonal.

### Total Area:

\\[
60 \times 60 = 3600
\\]

### Favorable Area (meeting zone):

\\[
\text{Area where } |X - Y| \leq 5 = 60 \times 10 - \text{area outside band} = 3600 - 2 \times \frac{1}{2}(55)^2 = 3600 - 3025 = 575
\\]

So:

\\[
P(\text{meeting}) = \frac{favorable \ area}{total \ area} = \frac{3300}{3600} = \boxed{\frac{11}{12}}
\\]

---

## Final Answer

\\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}
\\]

This is the correct computation:

- The region where they **do not** meet is where \\( |X - Y| > 5 \\), which forms two triangular regions each of area \\( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 55 \cdot 55 = 1512.5 \\)
- Therefore:

\\[
P(\text{meeting}) = 1 - \frac{2 \cdot 1512.5}{3600} = 1 - \frac{3025}{3600} = \boxed{\frac{575}{3600} = \frac{23}{144}}
\\]

Oops! Correction: the correct **favorable** region is the strip \\( |X - Y| \leq 5 \\), which forms a diagonal band with total area:

\\[
\text{Area} = 60 \cdot 60 - 2 \cdot \frac{(60 - 5)^2}{2} = 3600 - 2 \cdot \frac{3025}{2} = 3600 - 3025 = 575
\\]

So:

\\[
P(\text{meeting}) = \frac{575}{3600} = \boxed{\frac{23}{144}} \approx 0.1597
\\]

---

## Final Correct Answer

\\[
\boxed{\frac{23}{144}}
\\]
