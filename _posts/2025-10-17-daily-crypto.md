### **Market Overview (24h)**

The crypto market extended losses for a fourth consecutive session, with total market capitalization falling **4.9–5.3%** to **\$3.67–\$3.68 trillion** as of Friday morning UTC. Trading volume reached **\$234 billion**. Bitcoin dropped **4.4–4.5%** to **\$105,732–\$106,008**, briefly touching **\$104,782** before recovering slightly. Ethereum declined **5.6–6.0%** to **\$3,764–\$3,796**. Among major altcoins, BNB fell the steepest at **10–11%** to **\$1,046–\$1,151**, Solana declined **7.3–9.2%** to **\$179–\$186**, and XRP lost **6.0%** to **\$2.36–\$2.40**. Only Tron showed resilience, gaining **0.4%** to **\$0.3216** or down **4.3%** to **\$0.3079** depending on the reporting window. Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, **97 declined** over 24 hours.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9]

**Derivatives snapshot:** Bitcoin fell below its **200-day SMA near \$104,500**, a bearish technical signal. Funding rates turned **negative on Binance (-0.0006% to -0.0009%)** and mixed across venues, with most normalized to **+0.01%** (8h basis), signaling short bias despite stable open interest near **\$25 billion**. A spike in BTC **1-week 25 Delta Skew to 12.6%** indicated traders paying premiums for upside calls.[^10][^4][^11]

**Liquidations:** Over **\$1.2 billion** in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours ending October 17 (~06:00 UTC), with **79% long positions**. Bitcoin accounted for **\$344 million**, Ethereum **\$201 million**, and Solana **\$97 million**. The largest single liquidation was a **\$20.4 million ETH-USD long on Hyperliquid**. By exchange, Hyperliquid led with **\$391 million**, followed by Bybit (**\$300 million**), Binance (**\$259 million**), and OKX (**\$99 million**). This followed the week's **historic October 10–12 crash** that wiped **\$19.3 billion** in total liquidations.[^12][^13][^14][^15][^16]

**Stablecoin flows:** Total stablecoin market cap hit a record **\$314 billion**, with **USDT** (\$173B, 58% share) and **USDC** (\$74B) dominating. August 2025 data showed **\$51.7 billion** borrowed in on-chain stablecoin lending, with **\$14.8 billion** actively utilized.[^17][^18][^19]

**Sentiment:** The **Crypto Fear \& Greed Index** plunged to **22 points** ("extreme fear"), the lowest since April 2025, down from **28 points** 24 hours earlier and **53 points** a month prior.[^20][^21][^12]

### **Top Headlines (What \& Why it matters)**

**{Impact: High, Medium, Low}**

**{High}** **U.S. Bitcoin ETFs suffer largest outflows since August 1:** Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded **\$536.4 million in net outflows** on Thursday, October 16 (2025-10-16, Eastern Time), the largest single-day exodus since August 1, 2025 (\$327.9M). **ARK 21Shares' ARKB** led with **\$275.15 million** withdrawn, followed by **Fidelity's FBTC** (**\$132 million**) and **BlackRock's IBIT** (**\$29.4 million / 272 BTC**). Eight of 12 ETFs posted outflows; none recorded inflows. Weekly outflows totaled **\$858.7 million**. Analysts attributed the flight to **lingering tariff fears**, the **October 10–12 \$19B liquidation cascade**, and risk-off positioning ahead of the **October 29 FOMC meeting**. Despite outflows, BlackRock stated it expects "**tremendous**" growth for IBIT long-term, and the firm manages nearly **\$100 billion** in bitcoin assets.[^22][^23][^24][^25][^26]

**{High}** **Liquidation volume tops \$1.2B as Bitcoin drops below \$106K:** Bitcoin slid to **\$105,000** by October 17, 06:00 UTC (Friday early morning), extending Thursday's decline and triggering **\$1.2 billion in forced liquidations** over 24 hours ending ~06:00 UTC October 17. Nearly **307,000 accounts** were affected, with **79% long positions**. The sell-off followed persistent macro anxiety from the **October 10 Trump tariff announcement** (100% tariff on China, effective Nov 1) and a **failed rally attempt mid-week**. On-chain analysts warned of key liquidity levels at **\$102K and \$98.2K** as potential support; a daily close below \$98.2K would mark the first major structural shift since October 2023, potentially signaling a bull-market top. Bitcoin briefly recovered above \$108K but remains under pressure.[^27][^14][^16][^28][^29][^12]

**{Medium}** **Binance re-enters South Korea after four-year absence:** South Korea's **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)** approved Binance's acquisition of a **majority stake in GOPAX** on **Wednesday, October 16, 2025**, clearing the path for Binance to resume operations in South Korea after exiting in 2021 due to AML/KYC enforcement. The acquisition, announced in February 2023, was stalled for over two years amid regulatory scrutiny of Binance's compliance history and founder **Changpeng Zhao's November 2023 criminal conviction** in the U.S.. GOPAX confirmed its "board change report" received regulatory acceptance on October 16. Binance will restart operations, address **GOFi lending product liabilities** tied to **Genesis Global Capital's collapse**, and compete with South Korea's dominant local exchanges **Upbit and Bithumb**. CZ celebrated the milestone on X, October 16.[^30][^31]

**{Medium}** **North Korea weaponizes blockchain to hide malware:** **Google Threat Intelligence Group** and **Cisco Talos** independently confirmed that North Korean threat actor **UNC5342 (Famous Chollima)** is using **EtherHiding**—embedding malware in smart contracts on **BNB Chain** and **Ethereum**—to hide payloads and evade takedowns, marking the **first documented nation-state use** of blockchain for C2 infrastructure. Active since **February 2025**, the "Contagious Interview" campaign targets crypto developers and traders via fake job offers from impersonated firms like **Coinbase and Robinhood**. Victims download GitHub repositories containing **JADESNOW downloader**, which fetches payloads from BNB Chain contracts (e.g., **0x08ea8ac**) via **Binplorer API**. The technique allows decentralized, immutable hosting; attackers can update payloads for ~\$1.37 in gas fees per update. North Korea stole **\$1.3B in 2024** and **\$2.2B in H1 2025** to fund weapons programs.[^32][^33]

**{Medium}** **Stablecoin market cap hits record \$314B:** Total stablecoin supply reached an all-time high of **\$314 billion** as of mid-October 2025, driven by **USDT** (Tether, **\$173B supply**, 58% market share) and **USDC** (Circle, **\$74B**, 27%). The milestone follows the **GENIUS Act** taking effect, which treats compliant stablecoins like USDC as cash-equivalent by the U.S. government. **Canaccord Genuity** analysts project stablecoins could become the "money layer of the internet" and noted the market remains "underpenetrated" relative to the **U.S. M2 money supply** (~\$18.9T). In August 2025, **\$51.7 billion** in stablecoins were borrowed on-chain (highest since 2022 bear), with **427K loans** and **81K unique borrowers**. Average loan size recovered to **\$121K**. However, **Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr** warned of "run risk, reserve quality, and regulatory arbitrage" on October 15, urging strict rulemaking to prevent systemic threats.[^18][^19][^34][^17]

**{Medium}** **Trump tariff fears ease as president walks back China threat:** President Trump on **October 17** clarified that his **100% tariff on Chinese goods "won't stand"** as proposed, easing immediate concerns after his **October 10 Truth Social post** (late Friday EDT) triggered the historic **\$19B liquidation cascade**. The initial announcement—100% tariff effective November 1 in response to China's rare-earth export controls—sparked a **12% Bitcoin drop** (to \$102K intraday), wiping **\$500B+ from crypto market cap** over the weekend. Bitcoin briefly recovered **~2%** following Trump's October 17 walk-back comments. China signaled willingness to negotiate ahead of a potential Trump-Xi summit later this month. Markets remain cautious, with analysts noting the tariff whipsaw exposed crypto's sensitivity to macro policy shocks.[^13][^16][^28][^35][^29][^23][^22]

**{Low}** **Crypto fundraising tops \$19B in 2025, October accelerates:** Crypto and blockchain companies raised over **\$19 billion** in 2025 through October 17, with **27 deals totaling \$2.5 billion in October alone**, according to **DefiLlama** data. Investors now expect 2025 fundraising to exceed **\$25 billion** by year-end. Regulatory clarity from the **GENIUS Act** and improving macro sentiment fueled the acceleration. Notable October deals include infrastructure and DeFi protocols, though specific issuer names were not disclosed in aggregated data.[^36][^17]
*Primary sources:* [DefiLlama fundraising tracker, October 17]; [Yahoo Finance report, October 17][^36]

**{Low}** **Ethereum adds 16,181 new developers in 2025, leads all chains:** Ethereum welcomed **16,181 new developers** from January to September 2025, topping all blockchains, according to **Electric Capital** data shared by the **Ethereum Foundation** on October 15. The network now hosts **31,869 total active developers**, nearly double **Solana's 17,708**. Solana ranked second with **11,534 new developers**; Bitcoin third with **7,494**. Ethereum and Solana together account for nearly **half of all active blockchain developers globally**. Despite developer dominance, Ethereum's **DeFi TVL share stands at 67.5%** vs. Solana's **8.7%**. The data underscores Ethereum's structural lead in tooling and liquidity, while Solana gains traction in consumer apps and high-throughput DeFi.[^37][^38][^39][^40]
