**Market Structure:**
Total crypto market capitalization fell to \$3.67T (-1.74% in 24h) from the historic \$4T peak reached last week. Bitcoin dominance increased to 60.66% as altcoins declined more sharply. Trading volumes reached \$668.61B (-1.74%), reflecting continued high activity despite the pullback.[^9]

- **Record Bitcoin ETF Inflows Continue** - US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted \$875.6M on October 7, marking seven consecutive days of inflows totaling over \$5.2B. Year-to-date inflows reached \$25.9B, with BlackRock's IBIT leading at \$64.5B total assets. **{Medium Risk}**[^18][^19][^20]

- **Major Whale Opens \$900M Short Positions** - An \$11B Bitcoin whale allegedly opened massive short positions against BTC and ETH, signaling potential bearish sentiment from sophisticated investors. Market analysts debate whether this represents hedging or directional betting. **{High Risk}**[^24][^25]
