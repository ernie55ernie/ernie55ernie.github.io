### Market Overview (24h)

**Spot Prices (as of 21:00 UTC Nov 20)**

Bitcoin (\$BTC) trading at **$91,819**, up **+0.48%** in 24h; holding above key support. Ethereum ($ETH) at **$3,009.62**, down **−2.60%**; underperforming BTC. ETH-BTC ratio compressed to **0.0328** (−2.63% 24h), extending three-week downtrend. Solana ($SOL) at **\$142.24**, up **+2.10%** — outperforming as Fidelity ETF launches. BNB down −2.02%; XRP down −1.01%.

**Derivatives Snapshot**

BTC funding rates remain mildly positive at **0.0073%** (~8.01% annualized) on Binance — cautious-to-bullish bias. Open interest collapsed **−20% to −32%** (USD terms) since Oct 9 liquidation, signaling deleveraging and reluctance to re-enter longs. Deribit \$85,000 BTC puts now most popular (was \$140,000 calls weeks prior)—bearish sentiment dominance. Short-dated volatility elevated with strong skew towards put options. ETH options similarly bearish-tilted; realized volatility below implied, bracing for further spikes.

**Stablecoins**

USDT/USDC dominance stable; limited material flow data for Nov 20. Tether announced **\$250M USDT limit increase** at 01:00 UTC Nov 20. USDC minting on Solana jumped to **2.25B** tokens (weekly) — continued cross-chain expansion. Total stablecoin supply ~\$305B; flows relatively subdued during deleveraging cycle.
