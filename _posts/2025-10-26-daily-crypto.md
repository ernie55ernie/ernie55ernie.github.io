## Market Overview (24h)

**Bitcoin** traded at **\$111,620** (as of October 26, 2025, midnight UTC), up **1.85%** over 24 hours, holding above critical support around \$110,000. The cryptocurrency recovered from an early-October crash when BTC briefly dipped below \$105,000 following US-China trade tensions. **Ethereum** stood at **\$3,952** (+0.48% from prior day), consolidating below the psychologically significant \$4,000 level.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

Global crypto market capitalization reached approximately **\$3.75-3.92 trillion**, up **2.02-2.17%** over 24 hours. Total 24h trading volume: **\$238 billion**. The **Fear \& Greed Index** registered **40 (Fear)** on October 22, down from neutral levels, reflecting lingering caution following mid-October's \$19+ billion liquidation event.[^6][^2][^7]

**Derivatives context:** Bitcoin futures **open interest** remains stable near **\$25 billion**, with **funding rates** showing neutral to slightly positive bias (+0.01% on major exchanges). However, Binance and OKX exhibited negative funding rates (-2% to -3%), suggesting short bias among certain cohorts. Ethereum funding rates: +0.01% (8h normalized). CME Bitcoin futures traded at **\$124,155** in early October before the crash. The 1-week 25 Delta Skew spiked to **12.6%**, indicating traders paying premiums for call options despite recent volatility.[^8][^9][^10][^11]

**Stablecoin supply:** USDT market cap **\$183.1 billion**, USDC **\$75.9 billion** (combined: **~\$259 billion** of the **\$300+ billion** total stablecoin market). Stablecoin market cap surpassed **\$300 billion** in early October 2025, up from \$205 billion at year-start, with USDT at 58% and USDC at 25% market share.[^12][^13][^14][^15]

## Top Headlines (What \& Why It Matters)

### 1. **US-China Trade Breakthrough Lifts Crypto Markets**

**Risk:** Low
The US and China reached a preliminary trade framework agreement during President Trump's Asia tour (announced October 25, 2025, Saturday UTC), lifting total crypto market cap **1.77%** to **\$3.83 trillion**. China agreed to delay rare earth export controls by one year, easing supply chain fears. Bitcoin rallied above \$113,000 (peak \$113,367) on the news, while ETH climbed to \$4,049. *Why it matters:* Reduced geopolitical tensions improve risk appetite; macro tailwinds from easing trade war historically correlate with crypto inflows.[^3][^27][^4]

### 2. **JPMorgan to Accept Bitcoin \& Ethereum as Loan Collateral (Late 2025)**

**Risk:** Medium
JPMorgan Chase announced plans to let institutional clients pledge **BTC and ETH** as collateral for loans by end-2025, using third-party custodians (disclosed October 23-24, 2025 UTC). This follows JPMorgan's June 2025 approval of crypto ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, GBTC) as collateral with 25% loan-to-value. CEO Jamie Dimon, once calling Bitcoin a "fraud" and "pet rock," now says "I defend your right to buy Bitcoin". *Why it matters:* Marks Wall Street's deepest integration of digital assets into traditional lending; signals institutional legitimacy; may unlock liquidity for large holders without forced selling.[^28][^29][^30][^2]

### 3. **Ethereum ETF Outflows vs. Bitcoin Inflows (October 23, 2025)**

**Risk:** Medium
US spot Ethereum ETFs posted **\$93.6 million outflows** on October 23, led by BlackRock's ETHA (-\$101M), while Bitcoin ETFs gained **\$90.6 million** (Fidelity FBTC +\$57.9M, BlackRock IBIT +\$32.7M). ETH ETFs recorded second consecutive week of redemptions totaling **\$243.9 million**. Bitcoin ETF net assets: **\$149.96B** (6.78% of BTC market cap); ETH ETF assets: **\$26.39B** (5.55% of ETH cap). *Why it matters:* Divergent flows highlight rotation from ETH to BTC amid US government shutdown (day 22-25) and valuation debates; ETH's underperformance vs. BTC signals weaker institutional conviction short-term.[^31][^32][^33]

### 4. **CME Launches 24/7 Crypto Futures Trading (Early 2026)**

**Risk:** Low
CME Group announced plans to launch **24/7 trading** for cryptocurrency futures and options beginning early 2026 (disclosed October 12, 2025 UTC). CME also launched **options on Solana (SOL) and XRP futures** on October 13, 2025—the only CFTC-approved SOL and XRP options in the US. CME's new **Spot-Quoted Bitcoin (QBTC)** and **Ether (QETH)** futures gained traction with 400K contracts (\$380M notional) traded since launch; QETH peak: 24K contracts Sept 30. *Why it matters:* Aligns regulated derivatives with 24/7 crypto spot markets; increases institutional access and capital efficiency; validates crypto as permanent asset class in TradFi infrastructure.[^34]

### 5. **Bitcoin Accumulation Signals Mid-Cycle Correction, Not Bear Market**

**Risk:** Low
On-chain data shows **holders of 1-1,000 BTC accumulated** since early October despite prices falling from \$118K to \$108K. Glassnode's **VRV-Score** sits at **2.15**, historically a "smart money accumulation" zone (below 2 = significant holder stress; scores rarely above indicate overheating). Futures open interest peaked at **\$52B** before October 10-11 liquidation cascade; leverage now normalized to **61st percentile**. **95% of BTC addresses remain in profit**; unrealized profit/loss ratio: **0.53**. *Why it matters:* Technical and on-chain metrics suggest October's ~18% drawdown was a leverage flush, not trend reversal; compares to late 2020 setup before 170% Q1 rally.[^35][^36]

### 6. **Crypto Trader Profits \$17M on BTC/ETH Longs During October Volatility**

**Risk:** Low
A whale identified as "0xc2a" earned **~\$17 million** from long positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum during October's market turbulence (disclosed October 26, 2025). The trader opened longs just before last week's recovery, with BTC and ETH rising 4% and 2% respectively. The whale currently holds **~\$300 million** in long positions and has a **perfect win rate** since account inception. *Why it matters:* Demonstrates sophisticated institutional positioning during volatility; reinforces narrative that October dip was accumulation opportunity for experienced traders.[^37]

### 7. **XRP ETF Approval Timeline Uncertain Amid US Government Shutdown**

**Risk:** Medium
Six XRP spot ETF applications (Grayscale, Bitwise, CoinShares, Wisdom, Canary, 21Shares) await SEC approval with deadlines **October 18-25, 2025**. US government shutdown (now week 4 as of Oct 26) halted SEC registration statement processing. Trump advisor Kevin Hassett indicated shutdown may end "this week" (week of Oct 20). XRP traded at **\$2.64** on October 26 (+2.2% 24h, +26% YTD). Private roundtable with Coinbase, Ripple, Circle and US Senators scheduled **October 22, 2025**. *Why it matters:* XRP ETF approval could trigger \$4-8B first-year inflows (analysts' estimates); shutdown delays regulatory clarity; October remains plausible if government reopens.[^19][^38][^39][^40]

### 8. **October 2025: Largest Crypto Liquidation Event in History**

**Risk:** High (already occurred)
Over **\$19 billion in leveraged positions** were liquidated October 10-11, 2025, marking the **largest single-event wipeout in crypto history**. Bitcoin plunged **>14%** to ~\$104,782; Ethereum dropped **~12%**; smaller altcoins fell **40-70%** before partial recovery. The crash was triggered by President Trump's announcement of **100% tariff on Chinese imports** (October 10, 2025). Total 24h liquidations: **\$415 million** (70% longs, 30% shorts); ETH liquidations: \$115M, BTC: \$80M. *Why it matters:* Exposes crypto's sensitivity to macro shocks and overleveraged positioning; markets have since stabilized, but event underscores systemic risk from high leverage.[^10][^5][^37]

## Exchanges

### **Listings/Delistings:**

- **Bybit \& OKX delisting Kadena (KDA)** after Kadena blockchain announced closure of operations (October 22, 2025). OKX halted KDA deposits, will stop spot trading **October 26**, full delisting **October 29**; withdrawals disabled **January 22, 2026**. KDA crashed **-65%** to \$0.072 (down **99.7%** from \$27.64 ATH). **Risk: Low** (single-asset event).[^41]
- **Meteora (MET) listing:** Trading started on **OKX, Bybit** and others (October 23, 2025). MET launched at **\$0.613**, FDV **\$613M**. **Risk: Low**.[^42]


### **Maintenance/Outages:**

- **Crypto.com USD fiat wallet maintenance:** Vendor "Greendot" scheduled maintenance **9:00 PM PT October 25 to 1:00 AM PT October 26, 2025** (October 26, 05:00-09:00 UTC). **Risk: Low**.[^43]
- **Coinbase scheduled maintenance:** Saturday, October 25, ~7:00 AM PT, expected duration up to 4 hours. **Risk: Low**.[^44]


### **Service Changes:**

- **Bybit discontinues Web3 services** (October 2025): Shut down NFT marketplace, Cloud Wallet, Keyless Wallet, multi-chain DEX, and Swap \& Bridge widget. Users required to transfer assets before deadlines to alternative wallets. Move follows **\$1.4B hack in February 2025**. **Risk: Medium** (affects user experience but assets protected if timely action taken).[^45][^46]


### **Exchange Rankings:**

- **Kraken ranked \#1 global crypto exchange** for Q3 2025 by Kaiko—first-ever top finish, up from \#3 in Q1 and \#2 in Q2. Kraken Q2 2025 revenue: **\$412M** (+18% YoY); total volume: **\$186.8B** (+19% YoY); 9M+ clients across 190 countries. **Risk: N/A** (positive industry news).[^47]

***

## Regulation/Law

### **United States:**

- **SEC \& CFTC Joint Harmonization Initiative (September 4-5, 2025):** SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham issued joint statement announcing **September 29, 2025 joint roundtable** to discuss regulatory harmonization for digital assets. Focus: "innovation exemptions" for peer-to-peer spot crypto trading over DeFi protocols, perpetual contracts, 24/7 trading, prediction markets, portfolio margining, streamlined data standards. SEC's **Spring 2025 Regulatory Agenda** includes rulemakings on crypto asset offers/sales, custody modernization, dealer definitions, and transfer agent rules. CFTC reopening comment on **event contracts**. *Significance:* Marks shift from "regulation by enforcement" to proactive rulemaking; aims to solidify US as global crypto leader.[^48][^49]
- **Trump nominates SEC Crypto Task Force head to lead CFTC:** President Trump formally nominated **SEC Crypto Task Force head** as next CFTC Chair (disclosed October 24-25, 2025). *Significance:* Signals continued crypto-friendly policy direction.[^50]
- **US Government Shutdown (Week 4):** Ongoing shutdown (as of October 26, 2025) halted SEC processing of crypto ETF applications, including XRP, Cardano, and others. Trump advisor indicated potential resolution "this week". **Risk: Medium** (delays regulatory decisions).[^38][^40]


### **EU/MiCA:**

- **MiCA white paper deadline: December 23, 2025:** Issuers of crypto assets listed on EU exchanges must publish MiCA-compliant white papers meeting mandatory requirements (including ESG disclosures) or face **delisting**. MiCA fully applicable **December 30, 2024** (stablecoin rules since June 30, 2024). EU exchanges already contacting issuers for compliance ahead of deadline. *Significance:* Non-EU issuers impacted if seeking EU listing; forces standardization but creates compliance burden.[^51][^52][^53][^54]


### **Singapore (MAS):**

- **MAS clarifies Digital Token Service Provider (DTSP) regime (June 5, 2025):** From **June 30, 2025**, DTSPs serving only **customers outside Singapore** require licenses, but MAS will "generally not issue" licenses due to ML risks and supervisory limitations. DTSPs serving Singapore customers already regulated under existing frameworks. *Significance:* Tightens offshore DTSP operations; affects cross-border service models.[^55]


### **Taiwan (FSC):**

- **XREX Taiwan secured FSC approval** for virtual asset services (September 23, 2025). Taiwan's FSC introduced VASP AML guidelines in September 2023; draft crypto-specific law announced **March 2025**. *Significance:* Taiwan moving toward formal crypto regulation; industry should monitor FSC developments.[^56][^57][^58]


### **Hong Kong:**

- **Hong Kong Stablecoin Ordinance (May 2025):** All HKD-pegged stablecoin issuers require **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) license**; stablecoins must be backed by high-quality liquid reserves with 1:1 value parity. Strict AML/CFT, regular audits, and disclosure requirements. *Significance:* One of the most recent global stablecoin regulations; sets high compliance bar.[^59]

## Security Incidents

### **Confirmed Exploits (October 2025):**

1. **Typus Finance (Sui-based) hack: \$3.44M (October 2025):** Attacker exploited unaudited custom oracle and missing assert statement in oracle contract, bypassing authorization checks. Stolen: SUI, USDC, xBTC, suiETH, bridged to Ethereum and swapped to DAI. Typus paused all contracts post-incident. **Lesson:** Use audited, trusted oracle implementations (e.g., Chainlink); comprehensive audits mandatory before deployment. **Risk: Medium** (single-protocol impact).[^65]
2. **Abracadabra (DeFi lending) hack: \$1.8M (October 2025):** Exploited logical errors in v4 deprecated cauldrons' cook function on Ethereum, disabling solvency checks via else block that reset needsSolvencyCheck to zero. Attacker drained **1.79M MIM**, laundered via Tornado Cash. Abracadabra purchased 1.79M MIM to maintain peg. *Note:* Third major exploit for Abracadabra (January 2024: \$6.4M; March 2025: \$13M). **Risk: Medium** (repeated vulnerabilities suggest systemic issues).[^66]
3. **NuGet supply chain attack targeting Nethereum (mid-October 2025):** Malicious packages "NethereumNet" and "Netherеum.All" mimicked legitimate Nethereum library, stealing wallet keys and credentials. Packages published **October 16, 2025**, detected **October 18**, removed **October 20**—4-day exposure window. Malicious code exfiltrated private keys, mnemonics, keystore files, and signed transactions to C2 server via HTTPS POST. **Risk: High** (affects developers; supply chain attacks escalating).[^67]

### **Other Notable Security Events:**

4. **North Korea-linked hackers: \$2B+ stolen in 2025 (as of October 6, 2025):** Already surpassing all previous annual records with 3 months remaining. February **Bybit hack: \$1.46B** (largest crypto theft ever) attributed to North Korea's Lazarus Group. Cumulative known theft since 2017: **>\$6B**. Tactics shifted to **social engineering attacks** targeting individuals over technical exploits. **Risk: High** (systemic threat; funds laundered via complex cross-chain strategies).[^68][^69][^70]
5. **npm JavaScript package "error-ex" hack (September 2025):** Hackers compromised npm account, injected malicious code into "error-ex" (1B+ downloads). Malware monitors crypto activity, swaps wallet destinations during BTC/ETH/SOL transactions. Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet warned users; advised hardware wallet confirmation. **Risk: High** (massive potential exposure; possibly "largest open-source supply chain attack in history").[^71]
6. **Red Hat Consulting GitLab breach (October 2025):** Threat actors ("Crimson Collective") breached self-managed GitLab, exfiltrating **~570 GB** from 28,000+ repositories, including **~800 Customer Engagement Reports** with infrastructure details, config data, auth tokens. **Risk: High** (enterprise-wide implications; follow-on attacks possible).[^72]

## What to Watch (Next 24-72h)

### **Events \& Catalysts:**

1. **US Government Shutdown Resolution:** Potential end of shutdown (week of Oct 20-26) would enable SEC to resume XRP, Cardano, and other crypto ETF application reviews. **Watch:** Trump advisor comments and Congressional funding votes.[^40][^38]
2. **FOMC Meeting (Next Week):** Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for **October 29-30, 2025** with projected rate cut. **Significance:** Dovish policy could boost risk assets including crypto; Bitcoin correlates with liquidity conditions.[^33][^35]
3. **MiCA White Paper Compliance Deadline (December 23, 2025):** EU exchanges requiring issuers to update white papers ahead of deadline; early compliance activity accelerating. **Watch:** Potential delistings of non-compliant tokens.[^54]
4. **CME SOL/XRP Options Trading Momentum:** Newly launched (Oct 13) CME options on Solana and XRP futures could attract institutional flows. **Watch:** Open interest growth and volume trends.[^34]
5. **Bitcoin Price Action Around \$110K-\$114K:** Key resistance at \$112,400 (50-day MA) and \$114,100 (100-day MA). Support at \$108,200 (200-day MA). **Watch:** Funding rate shifts and large liquidation levels (Coinglass heatmap: \$110,009 key level).[^73][^10]
