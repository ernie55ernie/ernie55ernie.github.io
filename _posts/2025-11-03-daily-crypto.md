### **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

**-  Balancer DeFi Protocol Exploited for \$116–128 Million** (Nov 3, ~09:18 UTC)[^17][^18][^19][^20][^21]
**What:** Attackers drained Balancer V2 liquidity pools across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, and Sonic. Stolen assets: **6,850 osETH, 6,590 WETH, 4,260 wstETH**. Root cause: smart contract vulnerability in `validateUserBalanceOp` function allowed unauthorized internal withdrawals.[^18][^19][^17]
**Why:** Third major Balancer breach since 2020. BAL token fell **8–10%** to \$0.91. Berachain halted its network to deploy emergency hard fork. **Risk: High** – exploits affecting \$750M TVL protocols erode DeFi confidence.[^22][^17][^18]

**-  Fed Chair Powell Cools Rate-Cut Expectations, Triggering \$395M Crypto Liquidations** (Nov 2–3)[^6][^7][^5]
**What:** Powell stated December rate cut "not a foregone conclusion" after October's 25-bps cut to 3.75–4%. U.S. dollar strengthened; crypto risk appetite collapsed.[^5][^6]
**Why:** Liquidations spiked to **\$395.7M** (Nov 3) and **\$800M** (last week), overwhelming leveraged longs. Bitcoin fell below **\$108K** support; traders now await clearer signals as government shutdown delays labor data. **Risk: High** – macro uncertainty persists into December.[^7][^23][^6][^5]

**Why:** Institutional caution amid Fed uncertainty and stronger dollar. Ethereum ETFs also bled **\$98M** on Nov 1. **Risk: Medium** – outflows signal profit-taking, but Q3 2025 saw **\$9.6B inflows** for ETH ETFs, **\$8.7B for BTC**, suggesting structural demand intact.[^26]

**Why:** Reaffirms Strategy as world's largest corporate BTC holder. Public companies (ex-mining) now hold **875,580 BTC** (\$94.34B, 4.39% of circulating supply). **Risk: Low** – signals continued institutional conviction despite volatility.[^33]

Daily emissions: Solana, DOGE, Worldcoin, AVAX contributing **\$109M**. **Risk: High** – additional supply pressure during weak sentiment.[^70][^71][^72]

**-  BTC Key Levels:** Support at **\$106,000–\$107,000**; resistance **\$112,500–\$115,000**. Death Cross forming (50-day EMA approaching 100-day EMA). Weekly close below **\$100K** could confirm downtrend. **Risk: High** – technical breakdown risk.[^9][^73][^74][^28][^26]

**-  ETH Support Test:** Critical zone **\$3,608–\$3,700** (200-day EMA). Perpetual short pressure dominant; historical accumulation signal if holds. **Risk: Medium** – potential short squeeze if breaks **\$3,875**.[^75][^76][^26]

**-  Fed December Cut Probability:** CME FedWatch Tool now **67–69.3%** for another 25-bps cut. Next FOMC meeting mid-December. **Risk: High** – volatility likely around data releases (jobs, CPI).[^23][^6][^24]

**-  Bitcoin ETF Flows:** Monitor reversal of **\$799M outflows**. Bitwise forecasts record Q4 inflows to exceed **\$36B annual**. **Risk: Medium** – flow reversal could stabilize BTC above \$110K.[^25][^69][^24][^26]

**-  Hong Kong FinTech Week (Nov 3–7):** Regulatory announcements from SFC/HKMA; stablecoin licensing updates; potential exchange/custody partnerships. **Risk: Low** – news flow likely positive for adoption narratives.[^48][^77][^47][^40]

**-  Balancer Post-Mortem:** Official exploit analysis, compensation plans, security audits. **Risk: High** – DeFi sector credibility at stake.[^20][^18][^17]
