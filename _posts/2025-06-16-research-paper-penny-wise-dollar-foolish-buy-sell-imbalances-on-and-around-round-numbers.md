## Abstract Summary

This paper investigates how stock traders use round numbers as cognitive reference points. By analyzing over 100 million stock transactions, the authors show that there is consistent excess buying just below round numbers (e.g., $6.99) and excess selling just above them (e.g., $7.01). This behavior leads to significant buy-sell imbalances and suboptimal trading outcomes, including an estimated $1 billion annual wealth loss due to these biases. The study explores three main effects — the **left-digit effect**, the **threshold trigger effect**, and **cluster undercutting** — which together explain this round number phenomenon.

## Key Ideas and Comments

### Page 3 Paragraph 1
- **Key Idea**: Traders treat round numbers as psychological thresholds, triggering distinctive trading actions when prices approach these levels.
- **Comment**: Fundamental behavioral finance insight ideal for designing D0 alphas that exploit price movement patterns near integers.

### Page 3 Paragraph 2
- **Key Idea**: Empirical confirmation of three effects — left-digit, threshold trigger, and cluster undercutting — using a massive trade dataset.
- **Comment**: These effects offer actionable frameworks for building trading rules that generalize well across markets and geographies.

### Page 5 Paragraph 2
- **Key Idea**: Quantifies the economic cost of these behavioral biases at approximately $1 billion per year in lost wealth.
- **Comment**: Highlights the real-world profitability of trading strategies that anticipate and exploit round number behaviors.
