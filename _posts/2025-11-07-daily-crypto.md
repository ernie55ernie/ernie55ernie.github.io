### **Market Overview (24h)**

**Spot Prices (as of ~09:30 UTC Nov 7):**[^1][^2][^3]

- **BTC:** \$100,965 (-1.95% / 24h), trading range \$100,301–\$103,626. Down ~11% since Oct 6 peak.
- **ETH:** \$3,304 (-2.43% / 24h), consolidated around \$3,283–\$3,309. Down ~15% over past week.
- **Major alts:** SOL \$154.92 (-2.78%), BNB \$957.28 (+0.39%), XRP \$2.197 (-4.84%), DOGE \$0.1614 (-1.0%), ADA \$0.5354 (-0.85%).
- **Total market cap:** \$3.37T (CoinMarketCap), down ~1.72% from prior 24h, but showing first stabilization after four-day slide.[^2][^4][^3]

**Derivatives \& Funding:**[^5][^6][^7]

- **Funding rates:** Annualized ~10%, well below 2023 peaks (80%) and 2024 end-levels (40%), indicating reduced speculative leverage.[^5]
- **Open interest:** Down to \$24.9B from Oct highs; \$25B decline since peak reflects deleveraging.[^8]
- **Options activity:** Call-put ratio ~64%-35% (bullish lean), but elevated OI signals cautious positioning.[^9]

**Stablecoin Flows:**[^10][^11][^12]

- **USDT supply:** ~\$115B+ (Oct 2025), up from \$96B a year prior.[^11]
- **USDC supply:** ~\$58B (mid-2025), combined USDT+USDC at ~\$219B (+82% since 2021).[^12]
- **Monthly transaction volume:** Approaching \$1.25T (Sept 2025), up 87% YoY, outpacing PayPal throughput.[^13]

**Dominant Narrative:** Risk-off sentiment dominates; dollar strength + Fed caution + \$300B market wipe-out since early Oct. ETF outflows reversed Nov 6 (see below), but momentum fragile.[^4][^14][^8][^9]

**Risk Label:** **Medium** – Consolidation near key support; watch \$100K BTC / \$3,300 ETH.

### **What to Watch (Next 24–72h)**

1. **BTC Price Action Around \$100K Support (Critical Level)**[^3][^2][^8][^9][^48]
    - **Bull case:** Reclaim \$114K triggers short squeeze; ETF inflows sustain momentum → potential path to \$120K.[^9][^48]
    - **Bear case:** Break <\$100K risks cascade to \$93K (next major cost-basis cluster); \$92K CME gap cited as liquidity target.[^53][^48]
    - **Catalyst watch:** Fed rate decision rhetoric (next FOMC Dec 2025, but pre-meeting commentary key); US govt shutdown impact on data releases.[^17]
2. **ETH \$3,300–\$3,600 Range Resolution**[^54][^55]
    - **Key levels:** Support \$3,300–\$3,500; resistance \$3,800–\$3,900. Death cross (50-day/200-day MA) forming = medium-term bearish signal, but RSI oversold suggests near-term exhaustion.[^54]
    - **DeFi security sentiment:** Balancer exploit + \$200M combined losses (incl. Stream Finance) weigh on ecosystem confidence.[^54]
3. **Token Unlocks (High-Value, Nov 7–20)**[^56][^57]
    - **Nov 7 (today):** SUI \$102M (1.21% supply)[^57][^56]
    - **Nov 14:** PUMP \$51.2M[^57]
    - **Nov 16:** ARB \$24M (92M tokens, 2.8% supply)[^58]
    - **Nov 17:** ASTER \$85M[^57]
    - **Nov 20:** ZRO \$42.1M[^57]
    - **Risk:** High-ratio unlocks (e.g., OMNI 30.3%, LINEA 16.4%) may trigger short-term volatility.[^56]
4. **Telegram Cocoon AI Network Launch (November 2025)**[^59][^60][^61][^62]
    - **Details:** TON-based decentralized AI GPU network; developers pay in TON, GPU owners earn TON. Telegram as first client.[^60][^59]
    - **Why it matters:** Could drive TON utility + treasury accumulation (TON Strategy Co., AlphaTON Corp. already buying).[^63]
    - **TON price:** Currently ~\$2.12–\$2.20; analysts eye \$3.50 if Cocoon launch + altcoin season align.[^63]
5. **US Economic Data Releases (Potential Delays)**[^17][^24]
    - **Impact of govt shutdown:** Oct NFP, CPI releases may be delayed; Fed increasingly reliant on private data (ADP employment).[^17]
    - **Market sensitivity:** Risk-asset volatility tied to rate-cut expectations; next clarity post-Dec FOMC.
6. **Stablecoin Regulatory Updates (EU MiCA, US GENIUS Act Implementation)**[^36][^25][^24]
    - **Watch:** Further exchange compliance actions (delistings/listings) as MiCA whitepaper/reserve requirements enforced.
    - **US:** SEC/CFTC coordination on stablecoin "simple rules" legislation (Trump admin priority).[^25][^24]
7. **Institutional Flow Monitoring (ETF Data, Nov 7–10)**[^18][^16][^17]
    - **BTC ETF:** Nov 6 inflow (\$240M) broke 6-day streak; sustainability critical to confirm bottom.[^18][^17]
    - **ETH ETF:** \$12.5M inflow Nov 6; watch for ETHE outflows vs. ETHA/FETH inflows.[^16]
    - **SOL ETF:** Maintained \$29M cumulative inflows through Nov 6; bucking BTC/ETH trend.[^64][^53]
