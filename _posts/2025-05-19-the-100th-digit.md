You’re asked to solve a surprising numerical riddle:

> What is the **100th digit** **after the decimal point** in the expansion of:
>
> \\[
> (1 + \sqrt{2})^{3000}\;?
> \\]

## Step 1: Use the Conjugate Trick

Let:
\\[
A = (1 + \sqrt{2})^{3000}, \quad B = (1 - \sqrt{2})^{3000}
\\]

Then:

\\[
A + B \in \mathbb{Z}
\\]

Why? Because it's a symmetric expression formed from a binomial expansion with irrational terms canceling in pairs.

Also:
- \\(B = (1 - \sqrt{2})^{3000} \approx \text{a very small number}\\), since \\((1 - \sqrt{2}) \approx -0.414\\), and a small number raised to a high even power approaches 0.

---

## Step 2: Integer Minus Tiny Fraction

So we know:

\\[
A = \underbrace{(A + B)}_{\text{integer}} - B
\\]

This means \\(A\\) is **just less than an integer**, because you're subtracting a tiny positive number from a whole number.

## Step 3: Decimal Expansion Insight

Since \\(A\\) is slightly less than an integer, its decimal expansion is:

\\[
A = \text{(integer)}.9999999999\ldots
\\]

This continues until the decimal catches up with the tiny subtraction \\(B\\).

In this case, since \\(B \approx (0.414)^{3000} \ll 10^{-100}\\), the first **at least 100 digits after the decimal** are all **9**.

## Final Answer

> The **100th digit after the decimal point** in \\( (1 + \sqrt{2})^{3000} \\) is:
>
> \\[
> \boxed{9}
> \\]
