This classic logic puzzle tests your deductive reasoning with minimal information:

> You have **three bags**:
> 1. One has only **apples**
> 2. One has only **oranges**
> 3. One has a **mix of both**
>
> Each is labeled (“apple,” “orange,” or “mix”) — but **all labels are wrong**.  
> You may reach into any bag and pull out **one fruit at a time (without looking)**.  
>
> **Goal:** Determine the correct contents of all three bags with the **fewest possible pulls**.

## Step-by-Step Strategy

### Step 1: Pick the Bag Labeled “Mix”

Since **all labels are wrong**, the bag labeled “mix” **must contain only apples or only oranges**.

Reach into the **bag labeled “mix”** and pull out **one fruit**.

Let’s say you pull out an **apple**.

Then you know:
- This bag is **definitely not mix**, and not labeled “apple” either (since label is wrong).
- So it must be the **apple-only** bag.

### Step 2: Deduce the Others

Now you know:
- The bag labeled “mix” actually contains **only apples**.
- The bag labeled “apple” **can’t** be apples or mix → must be **orange-only**
- The bag labeled “orange” must then be the **mix**.

Same logic holds if you’d pulled out an orange first.

## Final Answer

> **Pull one fruit from the bag labeled “mix.”**  
> If it's an apple → that bag is apples.  
> Use the “all labels wrong” rule to deduce the other two.
