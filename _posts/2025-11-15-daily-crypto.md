### Market Overview (24h)

Bitcoin dropped sharply to six-month lows, trading at \$94,456 as of midnight UTC on November 15 (08:00 Asia/Taipei), down 5.29% from \$99,730 the previous day. Ethereum fell to \$3,162, down 0.93%, breaking below key support levels. The global crypto market cap stood at \$3.24T, down 0.77% over 24 hours. **Risk: High**[^1][^2][^3]

**Dominant narrative**: Macro uncertainty and liquidity crunch. Bitcoin briefly tested \$100,000 intraday on November 14 before plummeting below \$95,000, marking a breakdown from October's highs and entering a technical correction. The selloff coincided with weakness in traditional risk assets as diminishing Fed rate-cut expectations and a 43-day U.S. government shutdown (ended November 14) drained liquidity.[^3][^4][^5][^6]

**Derivatives snapshot**: Total liquidations exceeded \$1.36 billion in 24 hours ending November 14, with \$1.205 billion from long positions. Bitcoin-linked liquidations alone topped \$510 million. Funding rates turned negative across multiple tokens, signaling bearish positioning. Open interest in BTC futures remains flat while altcoin OI declined 5%+, indicating capital outflows. CME Bitcoin futures showed daily volume of ~14,263 contracts with open interest at 28,272 contracts as of November 7.[^7][^8][^9][^10][^11]

**Stablecoin flows**: USDT market cap grew steadily to \$175B by end-September 2025 (up 25% YTD), while USDC declined to \$73.7B despite a 108% YoY increase by November. Weekly USDT net transfer volumes remained between \$30-50B through Q3, but both stablecoins saw significant burn activity in September exceeding \$9B.[^12][^13]

**Top altcoin performance (November 14-15)**: SOL \$141.45 (-0.37%), BNB \$937.47 (+2.24%), XRP \$2.26 (-1.11%), ADA \$0.50 (-2.49%), DOGE \$0.16 (-0.42%), AVAX ~\$19.51 (+0.17%), TON \$2.26 (+0.67%). Privacy coins ZEC (+1,764% over 90 days) and DASH (+267%) were notable outperformers. **Risk: High** for most altcoins given 9%+ ETH decline and broad weakness.[^2][^14][^15][^10]
