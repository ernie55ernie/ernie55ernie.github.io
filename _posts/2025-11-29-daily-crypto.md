title: "Daily Crypto Market Brief - BTC Steady Near 90K Amid CME Outage Calm"
date: 2025-11-29
category: crpyto
---
### **Market Overview**

* **Price Action:** **Bitcoin (BTC)** is trading stably around **\$90,950** (-0.4% 24h), consolidating after a dip-buying rebound. **Ethereum (ETH)** is grinding upward at **~\$3,033**, while **Solana (SOL)** faces resistance near **\$137–\$144**.[^1][^2][^3]
* **Dominant Narrative:** **"Unexpected Tranquility"** prevails following a major **CME Group** trading halt. A cooling failure at a CyrusOne data center in Chicago paused global futures and options trading for ~10 hours on Friday (Nov 28), dampening volumes and volatility.[^4][^5]
* **Institutional Flows:** Institutions are aggressively buying the dip. **Ark Invest** added \$88M in BTC and **BlackRock** purchased \$68.8M in ETH earlier this week. **Circle** minted 500M **USDC** in 48h, signaling liquidity redeployment.[^6][^7]
* **Derivatives:** Funding rates are ticking back to positive, indicating a return of bullish sentiment despite the low-volume holiday weekend.[^8][^1]


### **Top Headlines**

* **Naver Financial Acquires Upbit Operator (\$10.3B)**
Naver Financial (subsidiary of Korean tech giant Naver) agreed to acquire **Dunamu** (operator of Upbit) in a stock swap valued at **~\$10.3 billion**. The deal creates a massive fintech/crypto conglomerate in South Korea.[^9][^10]
* **Upbit Suffers \$36M–\$50M Hack**
Shortly after the acquisition news, Upbit lost **~\$36M** (some reports say up to \$50M) in **Solana-based tokens** due to a security breach. The exchange has paused deposits/withdrawals and pledged to cover all user losses.[^11][^12]
* **SEC Chair Atkins Pushes "Project Crypto"**
SEC Chairman **Paul Atkins** (who replaced Gary Gensler in Jan 2025) outlined "Project Crypto," an initiative to establish a formal token taxonomy and "Regulation Crypto" for tailored disclosures and exemptions. This marks a pivot toward regulatory clarity.[^13][^14]
* **CME Futures Trading Halted by Data Center Outage**
A critical cooling issue at a CyrusOne facility in Chicago forced **CME Group** to halt all futures and options trading for over 10 hours on Nov 28. Markets have since resumed, but the outage contributed to the day's flat price action.[^5][^4]
* **Circle Expands Stablecoin Supply**
Circle issued an additional **500M USDC**, bringing its recent minting total to **1.25B USDC** over 3 days. This liquidity injection is often a precursor to capital rotation into BTC and high-beta altcoins.[^7]


### **Exchanges**

* **Upbit:** Deposits and withdrawals remain suspended following the Solana-token hack; investigation ongoing.[^11]
* **Binance:** Removed four spot trading pairs (including **GMT/BTC** and **ME/BTC**) on Nov 28 following a liquidity review.[^15]
* **CME Group:** Operations fully restored after the Nov 28 data center outage.[^5]


### **Regulation & Law**

* **USA (SEC):** Chairman Atkins is advancing "Project Crypto" to coordinate oversight with the CFTC and reduce duplicative licensing for crypto intermediaries.[^13]
* **South Korea:** Regulatory scrutiny is expected for the **Naver-Dunamu** merger due to its market dominance potential.[^10]


### **Research & Technical Reports**

* **Coinbase & Glassnode (Q3/Q4 Outlook):** Report highlights **Bitcoin dominance hitting 64%** (highest since 2021) and a decisive flip in **Ethereum** sentiment from capitulation to belief. Institutional ETF inflows are the primary driver of the current cycle.[^16]
* **Retail Activity:** Retail participation is rising but remains below 2021 peaks, with **Solana** capturing a significant share of new retail capital inflows compared to ETH.[^17]


### **Security Incidents**

* **Upbit:** Confirmed theft of **~44.5 billion KRW (~\$30M+)** in Solana ecosystem tokens. Attack vectors suspect private key compromise or wallet handling flaw.[^12]
* **2025 Statistics:** This year has set a record for crypto hacks, with over **\$2.17 billion** stolen by mid-year, driven heavily by centralized service breaches.[^18]


### **What to Watch (Next 24–72h)**

* **BTC \$90k Defense:** Bulls need to hold the **\$90,000** support to attempt another breakout toward the **\$100,000** psychological barrier.[^1]
* **Upbit Resumption:** Watch for the reopening of deposits/withdrawals at Upbit; prolonged delays could impact regional volatility and the **Solana** ecosystem.
* **Market Open (Monday):** Volume is expected to return as US traders come back from the holiday weekend and the CME backlog clears.
* **Solana ETF Flows:** Monitor for reversals after recent outflows (-\$8.1M) amid the Upbit hack news.[^19]

**Confidence:** High. All major items (Price, Naver/Upbit deal, CME outage, Atkins/SEC) verified at primary or reputable secondary sources.
