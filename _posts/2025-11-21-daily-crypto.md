## **Market Overview (24h)**

Bitcoin plunged to \$82,000–\$85,400 on November 21, 2025, marking a **7–8.4% decline** across major assets in the past 24 hours. Total crypto market capitalization fell below **\$2.95 trillion** for the first time since May 8, 2025, down from over \$3 trillion, representing an **8.15–8.81% drop**. Ethereum traded at \$2,717–\$2,784, Solana at \$127–\$132, XRP at \$1.96, and BNB at \$835–\$860, all falling **7–10.4%** in 24 hours.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8]

**Derivatives snapshot:** Nearly **\$958 million in liquidations** hit traders over 24 hours, with open interest across the market dropping **7% to ~\$133 billion**. Funding rates plunged and turned negative as leveraged longs were wiped out. The Fear and Greed Index sits at **14 (extreme fear)**, despite ticking up 2 points from the prior day. October's \$19 billion flash crash and subsequent liquidity strain continue to weigh on market makers six weeks later.[^9][^1]

**Stablecoin dynamics:** USDC hit an all-time high of **\$76 billion circulation** on November 21, 2025 (00:00 UTC per press time), up **78% annually**, with \$1 trillion transacted in November alone and 15% increased transfers in the past 24 hours. Tether minted **\$1 billion USDT** in the past 24 hours (November 20, 2025, timestamp not specified), though total stablecoin supply dipped slightly to **\$303.4 billion** from \$304.2 billion on November 16, 2025. USDT fell \$224 million in 24 hours while USDC gained \$19 million but lost \$1.13 billion over seven days. {**Risk:** Medium}[^10][^11][^12]

## **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

- **Record Bitcoin ETF outflows accelerate institutional flight** – BlackRock's IBIT hemorrhaged **\$355 million** on November 20, 2025 (reported November 21, 01:33 UTC), following a record **\$523 million outflow** on November 18, 2025, per Farside Investors and Arkham Intelligence. Total U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows hit **\$903 million** on November 20, 2025. November flows stand at **–\$3.79 billion**, positioning it as potentially the worst month on record. Fidelity's FBTC and Grayscale's GBTC also posted significant withdrawals. **Why it matters:** Institutional capital is exiting BTC exposure through the most liquid ETF vehicles, signaling risk-off behavior and amplifying downward pressure as spot holdings are sold T+1. {**Risk:** High}[^13][^14][^15][^16]
- **Binance CEO attributes BTC volatility to broad risk-off deleveraging** – Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, stated on November 21, 2025 (reported 02:00 UTC), that Bitcoin's 21.2% November decline and 23.2% three-month loss reflect risk aversion mirrored across major asset classes, not crypto-specific weakness. He noted consolidation is "healthy" after 1.5 years of strong performance, with BTC still double its 2024 value. **Why it matters:** The world's largest exchange acknowledges systemic deleveraging, contextualizing the drawdown within broader macro uncertainty (AI bubble fears, Fed policy) rather than isolated crypto contagion. {**Risk:** Medium}[^17][^18][^19]
- **GANA Payment suffers \$3.1M exploit on BNB Chain** – On November 21, 2025 (exact time not disclosed; reported 09:33 UTC by ZachXBT), decentralized payment protocol GANA Payment lost over **\$3.1 million** after attackers drained its smart contract, converting 1,140 BNB via Tornado Cash and bridging 346 ETH to Ethereum, where funds remain idle. The token crashed over **90%** post-exploit. No public audits or technical documentation existed prior to the breach. **Why it matters:** The attack highlights persistent DeFi vulnerabilities on BNB Chain, where over \$100 million has been lost to exploits in the past year; lack of audits continues to enable access-control attacks. {**Risk:** Medium}[^20][^21]
- **Thai authorities recover \$432,000 stolen crypto via real-time collaboration** – Thailand's Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB), in partnership with Binance, Bitkub, and Tether , announced in November 2025 (exact date: November 18, 2025, per report timestamp) the recovery of approximately **432,000 USDT** stolen from multiple Thai victims via malware targeting Google Authenticator backups and seed phrases. Tether froze the perpetrator's wallet; CCIB neutralized auto-sweep functions and safely transferred funds to government custody. The attacker, a foreign national from an Eastern European country, used P2P markets and Perfect Money. **Why it matters:** Demonstrates effective public-private coordination in crypto asset recovery, showcasing the role of real-time blockchain tracing and centralized stablecoin freezes in combating cross-border theft. {**Risk:** Low}[^22]
- **SEC Chairman Atkins unveils "Regulation Crypto" roadmap under Project Crypto** – On November 12, 2025 (reported November 16–18, 2025), SEC Chairman Paul Atkins outlined the next phase of "Project Crypto," including a formal token taxonomy grounded in the *Howey* test, tailored exemptions for crypto-asset offerings, and a forthcoming "Regulation Crypto" proposal expected in 2026. SEC-CFTC joint statements on September 2, 2025, announced coordination for spot crypto product listings on registered exchanges. Corp Fin issued no-action guidance on liquid staking (August 5, 2025) and DePIN token distributions (September 29, 2025). **Why it matters:** The SEC is transitioning from enforcement-driven to comprehensive rulemaking, providing regulatory clarity that could unlock institutional participation and reduce compliance uncertainty for crypto issuers and exchanges. {**Risk:** Low}[^23][^24][^25]
- **DeFi losses exceed \$3.1 billion in H1 2025, led by \$1.5B Bybit hack** – Cryptocurrency losses surpassed **\$3.1 billion** in the first half of 2025, already exceeding 2024's \$2.85 billion total, according to Hacken's report. The February 21, 2025, Bybit hack accounted for **\$1.5 billion** (Lazarus Group-linked). Access control vulnerabilities drove **59% of losses** (\$1.6 billion), while smart contract exploits contributed \$263 million (8%). North Korea-linked hackers stole over **\$2 billion** in 2025 across 30+ incidents. **Why it matters:** Escalating DeFi exploits and nation-state attacks underscore systemic security weaknesses, particularly in access controls and multisig processes; social engineering has replaced technical flaws as the primary attack vector. {**Risk:** High}[^26][^27][^28][^29][^30][^31]
- **USDC surges to \$76B circulation as traders flee volatility** – Circle's USDC reached a record **\$76 billion** in circulation on November 21, 2025 (timestamp: per press, likely 00:00 UTC), growing **78% annually** and transacting over \$1 trillion in November alone. Circle minted **\$1.25 billion USDC** on Solana earlier in November, bringing Solana's USDC supply to **\$8.74 billion** (63% of network stablecoins). **Why it matters:** USDC's expansion during a \$1.5 trillion crypto market wipeout demonstrates flight-to-safety demand and its role as the "digital dollar" in on-chain economies; institutional trust (monthly Deloitte audits, 100% reserves) positions USDC for potential \$100B by mid-2026. {**Risk:** Low}[^10]

- **Upbit staking maintenance** – South Korean exchange Upbit conducted staking service maintenance for **one hour starting 10:00 UTC on November 21, 2025** (announced November 13, 2025). All Upbit Staking services temporarily suspended. {**Risk:** Low}[^36]
