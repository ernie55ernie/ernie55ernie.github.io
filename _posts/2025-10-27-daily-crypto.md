---

### **Market Overview (24h)**

Global cryptocurrency markets rebounded sharply on Monday, climbing 3.3%–3.5% to reach a total market capitalization of **\$3.89–3.99 trillion**. The rally follows easing **US-China trade tensions** after consultations in Kuala Lumpur resulted in "basic consensuses" on tariffs, fentanyl cooperation, and agricultural trade, plus mounting expectations for a **25 basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut** at the October 29 FOMC meeting (probability now 98.3%).[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

**Bitcoin** surged 3.05%–3.4% to trade at **\$115,000–\$115,200**, reclaiming its 50-day EMA (~\$114,176) and piercing key Fibonacci resistance at \$120,864. **Ethereum** rallied 5.6%–7.22%, clearing **\$4,160–\$4,206**—a seven-day high—with derivatives open interest rising 5.06% to \$49.81 billion and total volume spiking 69% to \$92.15 billion.[^7][^3][^8][^9][^10][^1]

**Altcoin leaders:** Solana +6%, BNB +2.4%, XRP +1.4%. **Bitcoin dominance** climbed to 59.2% (+1.35%). 24-hour trading volume surged 94.11% to **\$163.51 billion**, while DeFi volume stood at \$19.88 billion (12.16% of total).[^2][^3]

**Derivatives snapshot:** Over **\$317–\$393 million** in total liquidations, with **\$319.18 million from short positions**—a 92.79% short liquidation ratio for BTC alone. The largest single liquidation was a \$19.04 million BTC-USD order on Hyperliquid. Bitcoin funding rates remained neutral across major venues (Binance: 0.0007%, OKX: 0.0014%, Bybit: 0.0065%).[^11][^12][^13][^5][^14]

**Stablecoin context:** Total stablecoin supply is estimated at **\$283.2 billion** as of late October, with USDT accounting for ~\$183 billion and USDC circulating at ~\$74 billion. A fresh **\$250 million USDC mint** was reported on October 26.[^15][^16][^17]

### **Top Headlines (What & Why It Matters)**

**Market impact risk: {Low/Medium/High}; Timezone in parentheses (UTC unless noted)**

- **BNB completes 33rd quarterly burn worth \$1.66 billion** (Oct 27, 00:00 UTC)[^18][^19][^20][^21]
**Risk: Medium.** BNB Foundation destroyed **1,441,281.413 BNB** (~\$1.208–\$1.661 billion), reducing total supply to 137,738,379.26 BNB. The deflationary move helped BNB overtake XRP for the \#4 market-cap spot at **\$161 billion** vs. \$157.6 billion. BNB price rose 3% to \$1,168 following the announcement.[^22][^20][^18]
- **US President Trump pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (Oct 23, 13:21 EDT / 17:21 UTC)**[^23][^24][^25][^26]
**Risk: High.** Trump pardoned CZ, who served four months for violating anti-money laundering laws. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution "part of a war on cryptocurrency" under Biden. The pardon follows months of lobbying and raises questions about Binance's potential re-entry to US operations. CZ and Binance previously settled for \$4.3 billion after a DOJ investigation found the platform helped users evade sanctions.[^24][^27][^23]
- **Short squeeze triggers \$319M in liquidations; BTC reclaims \$115K (Oct 26, 09:00–23:35 UTC)**[^3][^13][^5][^1]
**Risk: Medium.** Bitcoin surged 318% above 24-hour average volume during a 09:00 UTC breakout, forcing \$172 million in BTC short liquidations (92.79% of total BTC liquidations) and \$115 million in ETH shorts (87.95%). Solana saw \$30.27 million liquidated (78.8% shorts). Volume remained elevated as BTC hovered near \$114,500 late Sunday (UTC).[^13][^5][^14]
- **Crypto investment products see \$921M inflows; Ethereum ETFs post first outflows in 5 weeks (Oct 21–27)**[^28]
**Risk: Medium.** Digital asset funds attracted **\$921 million** net inflows last week, with Bitcoin leading at **\$931 million** (YTD total now \$30 billion). US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded **\$446 million** inflows last week (BlackRock IBIT: \$432M, Fidelity FBTC: \$257M). Ethereum products saw **\$169–\$244 million** in outflows, marking their first decline in five weeks. ETP trading volume hit \$39 billion, well above the \$28 billion 2025 average.[^29][^28]
- **Mt. Gox delays creditor repayment deadline to October 2026 (Oct 27, announcement ~08:16 UTC)**[^30][^31][^32][^33]
**Risk: Low.** Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee extended the repayment deadline from October 31, 2025, to October 31, 2026, marking the third postponement. Most base, early lump-sum, and intermediate repayments have been completed, but many creditors failed to complete required procedures. Mt. Gox still holds ~34,690 BTC (~\$4 billion), down 75% from 142,000 BTC in mid-2024.[^31][^32][^30]
- **FTX completes \$1.6B third distribution to creditors (Sep 30, 2025)**[^34][^35][^36]
**Risk: Low** (stale but relevant). FTX Recovery Trust released \$1.6 billion on September 30, with US customers receiving 40% (cumulative 95% recovery) and Dotcom customers 6% (78% cumulative). Total distributions since collapse now exceed \$6 billion. Some analysts expected new liquidity to spark altcoin rallies, though market impact has been modest.[^35][^36]
- **Ethereum Pectra upgrade nearing completion; testnet deployment Oct 28**[^37][^38][^39][^40]
**Risk: Medium.** Ethereum's Fusaka (Prague + Electra) hard fork will apply to the Hoodi testnet on October 28. Pectra, which went live on mainnet May 7, 2025, introduced 20 EIPs including EIP-7251 (increase MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE for validators), EIP-7002 (execution layer withdrawals), and EIP-7623 (increase calldata cost to incentivize L2 blob usage). The upgrade aims to improve staking flexibility, Layer-2 scalability, and user experience.[^38][^39][^40][^37]

- **SEC and CFTC issue joint statement on spot crypto trading (Sep 2, 2025; published Sep 4)**[^46][^47][^48][^49]
**Risk: Medium** (stale but market-moving). SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham issued a landmark joint statement clarifying that registered exchanges (NSEs, DCMs, FBOTs) are *not prohibited* from listing and facilitating spot crypto asset products, including those involving leverage, margin, or financing. The agencies invited market participants to engage with staff for prompt review of proposals.

- **White House releases 180-Day Report on Digital Assets (July 30, 2025)**[^50][^51][^52]

***

### **Research/White Papers**

- **CME Group Q3 2025 Cryptocurrency Report (Oct 12, 2025)**[^54]
Q3 marked record-breaking institutional involvement: combined futures and options volume exceeded **\$900 billion** (ATH), with record ADOI of **\$31.3 billion** and notional OI peak of **\$39 billion** on Sep 18. Large open interest holders (LOIH) hit 1,014 the week of Sep 16, demonstrating broad institutional presence. Ethereum futures ADV surged 355% YoY (23.8K contracts), with ADOI up 441%. Solana and XRP futures also launched during the quarter.[^54]
- **HTX Research: "From AMM to CLOB: The 2025 Perpetual DEX Boom" (Oct 27, 2025)**[^55]
HTX Research highlights SunPerp as TRON's first native Perp DEX, leveraging TRON's ~\$80 billion USDT liquidity and high throughput to deliver gasless trading. Report notes 2025 as a transformative phase for Perp DEXs, with CLOB architectures and Layer-1 scalability narrowing the gap with centralized exchanges.[^55]
- **Aptos White Paper updated (Oct 23, 2025)**[^56]

***

### **Security Incidents**

- **Bunni DEX shuts down after \$8.4M exploit (Oct 23, 2025)**[^57]
**Risk: Medium.** Bunni DEX announced closure following an \$8.4 million exploit, marking the second major crypto project to shut down in October.[^57]
- **GMGN security incident reported (Oct 25–27, 2025)**[^58]
On October 27, GMGN Co-founder Haze posted on X that the team is investigating a security event. Details remain sparse, and no loss amount has been confirmed.[^58]
- **Typus Finance exploited for \$3.44M (Oct 15, 2025)**[^58]
Attacker exploited a critical vulnerability in Typus Finance's oracle module, draining 588,357.9 SUI, 1,604,034.7 USDC, 0.6 xBTC, and 32.227 suiETH from the TLP contract.[^58]
- **SBI Crypto suspected breach: \$21M outflow (Sep 24, 2025)**[^58]

***

### **What to Watch (Next 24–72h)**

- **FOMC meeting and rate decision (Oct 29, 14:00 EDT / 18:00 UTC)**[^40][^6][^59][^60][^61]
**Risk: High.** Fed rate decision with 98.3% probability of 25 bps cut. Softer CPI data (released Oct 24) and US-China trade progress bolster dovish sentiment. Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility dropped to 44%, reflecting reduced anxiety. A dovish tone could trigger upside continuation; a surprise hold or hawkish guidance could spark sharp downward moves.[^59][^32]
- **US-China presidential summit (Oct 30, South Korea)**[^6][^40]
**Risk: High.** Trump meets Xi Jinping in South Korea to discuss trade framework. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the 100% tariff on Chinese goods is unlikely to take effect. Improved US-China relations would support risk assets including crypto.[^6]
- **Major token unlocks (Oct 27–Nov 3)**[^62][^63][^64][^65][^66][^67]
**Risk: Medium.** Total ~\$653 million in unlocks: **GRASS** (181M tokens, \$80.27M, 72.4% of circulating supply, Oct 28 13:30 UTC), **JUP** (53.47M, \$23.29M, 1.72%, Oct 28 14:00 UTC), **ZORA** (166M, \$15.51M, 4.55%, Oct 30 00:00 UTC), **SUI** (43.96M, \$117M, 1.21%, Nov 1 00:00 UTC), **EIGEN** (36.82M, \$44.55M, 12.10%, Nov 1 04:00 UTC), **ENA** (40.63M, \$20.73M, 0.60%, Nov 2 07:00 UTC). Altcoin exchange inflows to Binance have declined sharply (7-day MA ~13,500 vs. 22,800 weeks prior), potentially absorbing sell pressure.[^63][^64][^67]
- **US Q3 GDP release (Oct 30, 08:30 EDT / 12:30 UTC)**[^9][^59]
**Risk: Medium.** Economic data will confirm whether Fed is adopting a softer stance. Partial government shutdown delayed September jobs report, leaving Fed with less clarity.[^59]
- **Ethereum Fusaka upgrade testnet deployment (Oct 28)**[^40]
**Risk: Low.** Fusaka hard fork goes live on Hoodi testnet, continuing Ethereum's post-Pectra upgrade rollout.
- **Core Scientific–CoreWeave merger vote (Oct 30)**[^40]
**Risk: Low.** Special stockholder meeting to vote on potential merger between crypto mining giant Core Scientific and cloud provider CoreWeave. Approval could impact blockchain infrastructure dynamics.[^40]
