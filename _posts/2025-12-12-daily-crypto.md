### Market Overview (24h)

Bitcoin is trading at \$92,494 as of Dec 12, 00:00 UTC (08:00 Asia/Taipei), down 2.7% from \$94,400 on Dec 11. Ethereum sits at \$3,236 (down 2.7% from \$3,326 the previous day), marking a -15.5% decline year-over-year. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization increased 1.9% to \$3.23 trillion, with 90 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posting gains in the last 24 hours; overall trading volume reached \$124 billion.[^1][^2][^3]

**Key altcoin movements:** Solana trades near \$144, XRP at \$2.04, BNB stable, with the AI and DePIN sectors experiencing sharp selling pressure post-Fed decision. The crypto market remains structurally fragile after the Federal Reserve delivered a 25 bps rate cut on Dec 11, 2025, 19:00 UTC (Dec 12, 03:00 Asia/Taipei), but Chair Powell's hawkish tone—projecting only two rate cuts in 2026 versus four previously anticipated—triggered a risk-off shift across digital assets.[^4][^5][^6][^7]

**Derivatives snapshot:** Bitcoin futures open interest stands at \$59.2 billion with \$97.3 billion in 24h futures volume versus \$8 billion spot. Ethereum futures open interest exceeds \$41.4 billion with \$91.3 billion in 24h turnover and \$5.8 billion spot volume. Funding rates remain slightly positive for BTC (+0.0047%) and neutral to slightly positive across major alts. **Liquidations:** Over \$376 million in positions liquidated in 24 hours ending Dec 11, with shorts accounting for \$297 million—Bitcoin contributed \$153 million and Ethereum \$110 million to total liquidations. A separate 24h window saw \$241 million in liquidations (BTC \$96.93M, ETH \$55.15M, SOL \$11.79M). **Risk:** Medium—Market digesting Fed guidance; volatility elevated.[^8][^6][^9][^10]

**Stablecoin flows:** USDT and USDC market caps reached all-time highs of \$185 billion and \$78 billion respectively in December. Tether minted an additional \$1 billion while Circle added \$500 million as of early December. Despite S&P's downgrade of USDT to "Weak" on structural reserve risks, USDT price remained anchored near \$1.00 with stable trading volume. Stablecoins now comprise 30% of all on-chain transaction volume, recording over \$4 trillion in 2025 YTD (83% increase vs. 2024).[^11][^12][^13]

Judge Engelmayer criticized Kwon's actions as creating a "house of cards" destined to collapse. **Impact:** High—Landmark enforcement action signals regulatory willingness to impose severe penalties for crypto fraud; sets precedent for future securities violations. **Sources:** U.S. District Court Southern District of New York (primary), FXStreet, NY Times, Yahoo Finance.[^14][^15][^16]

Cameron Winklevoss stated prediction markets have "potential to be as big or bigger than traditional capital markets". **Impact:** Medium-High—Opens compliant prediction market access for U.S. retail; increases competition with Kalshi, Polymarket; Gemini also plans to pursue U.S. crypto derivatives listings (futures, options, perpetuals). **Risk:** Low-Medium—Regulatory approval reduces compliance risk. **Sources:** CFTC public filings (primary), En.Cryptonomist, Genfinity, Yahoo Finance.[^20][^21][^22]

Ethereum ETFs outperformed with \$312.6 million in weekly inflows (82% of all Ether ETF allocations). BlackRock's IBIT led Bitcoin inflows with \$238 million. Recent daily flows (Dec 8-10): Bitcoin ETFs saw mixed activity with Dec 10 posting \$269.9M inflow, Dec 9 at \$33.8M, and Dec 8 at -\$169.1M outflow. **Impact:** Medium—Stabilization of ETF demand suggests institutional re-entry; dovish Fed expectations (85% probability of Dec rate cut as of late Nov) supported inflows. **Risk:** Medium—Flows remain volatile; sustainability uncertain. **Sources:** Bitbo.io (ETF flow data), AlphaNode Global, Investing.com.[^36][^37][^38]
