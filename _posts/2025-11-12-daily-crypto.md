### Market Overview (24h)

**Spot Prices:**[^1][^2]


| Asset | Price | 24h Change | Notable Context |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **BTC** | \$102,636–\$105,608 | –3% to –4% from \$107K peak | Held \$102K support; 8% weekly decline[^3] |
| **ETH** | \$3,416–\$3,556 | –4.15% to –0.58% | Pullback from \$3,576[^1] |
| **SOL** | \$158–\$169 | –3.53% | Institutional buying zone \$155–\$170[^4] |
| **BNB** | ~\$892–\$1,055 range forecast | Moderate pressure | Watchlist holding mid-range[^5] |
| **XRP** | \$2.40 | ~–1.74% | ETF anticipation fueling sentiment[^6] |
| **TON** | \$2.12–\$2.14 | Consolidating | Corporate treasury accumulation continues[^7][^8] |
| **ADA, DOGE** | \$0.5677, \$0.17495 | ~–1.93%, –1.81% | Altseason lag vs. BTC volatility[^6] |

**Global Market Cap:** ~\$3.79–\$4.02 trillion (–2.91% past 24h / –0.40% day-over-day), reflecting profit-taking after October recovery.[^2][^9]

**Derivatives Snapshot:** Bitcoin futures open interest fell to **\$68 billion** (from \$94B peak last month), signaling deleveraging post-Oct liquidation event. Funding rates **flat/neutral** (0.0068%–0.0072% on Deribit)—consensus breaking down. Options data shows **put skew building**: traders added downside hedges despite 6% rally, with dealer short gamma positioning on downside, typically creating head-fakes on bounces.[^10][^11][^12][^13]

**Stablecoin Activity:** USDT dominance in retail payments **83% market share (Q3 2025)**, with 64% in self-custodied wallets and 30% in small retail (\$10–\$100 balances). USDC commanding **50%+ of on-chain lending & DeFi** activity; genuine settlement driving higher share of throughput.[^14]

**Risk Label:** {High} — Technical breakdown, reduced leverage, and institutional hesitation near \$105K resistance creating distribution risk.

- Senate coalition (bipartisan) drafting bill to shift regulatory primacy from SEC to CFTC, streamlining compliance for institutional entry.[^27]
- U.S. crypto ETF fast-track rule proposed; 91 outstanding crypto ETF applications in pipeline; initial deadline Sep 13, extended to Mar 27, 2026.[^28]

### What to Watch (Next 24–72 Hours)

1. **XRP ETF Launch Execution (Thu, Nov 13–14 UTC):** XRPC begins trading; monitor opening spreads, inflows, and price reaction. First catalyst test for procedural auto-approval pathway. {High priority}
2. **Bitcoin Technical Retest (\$102K Support Hold vs. Break):** If BTC holds \$102K and re-enters \$105–\$107K resistance zone with volume, bullish setup confirmed. Failure to hold = test \$99K–\$96K. {High priority}
3. **Monad (MON) Pre-Sale Hype & Mainnet Launch (Nov 17 sale opens, Nov 24 mainnet):** Monitor pre-trade price discovery (\$0.025 offering), Coinbase platform stability, and institutional participation metrics. {Medium priority}
4. **Ethereum L2 Activity / Arbitrum TVL Trends:** Layer 2 ecosystem hitting all-time highs in transaction volume; watch for any protocol risks, especially post-Balancer exploit sentiment. {Medium priority}[^43][^44]
5. **U.S. Macro & Tariff Dividend Announcement Clarity:** Trump's proposed \$2K "tariff dividend" announcement may reignite risk-on sentiment or trigger renewed fiscal debate; monitors equity/crypto correlation. {Medium priority}[^3]
6. **Solana Institutional ETF Inflows Continuation:** If SOL inflows sustain >\$300M/week, confirms decoupling from BTC macro sentiment; watch for \$150 retest or \$170+ breakout. {Low–Medium priority}[^4]
