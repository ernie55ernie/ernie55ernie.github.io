### Abstract Summary

This paper explores the phenomenon where returns of certain stocks can predict the returns of others. By employing Granger causality regressions, the authors identify leader-follower pairs among individual stocks. These leader stocks can forecast the returns of follower stocks out-of-sample, and this predictability is shown to exist beyond industry-level correlations. A firm, regardless of its size, may emerge as a return leader if it is at the center of major news developments. Moreover, the number of followers a stock has is shown to increase when it experiences newsworthy events. The study provides evidence that return leadership can be both short-lived and tied to firm-specific news rather than broader market factors.

## Key Ideas by Page

### Page 1, Paragraph 2

This section raises the core research question: can one firm’s stock returns predict another’s, especially when firms are not linked by fundamentals? The authors highlight this as a sign of information flow inefficiencies within the market, setting the stage for exploring return leadership beyond traditional firm connections.

### Page 3, Paragraph 4

Here, the methodology is outlined: the authors use Granger causality tests on stock returns to identify predictive relationships. Importantly, their approach does not rely on pre-defined connections like shared industries, allowing them to discover surprising and potentially lucrative leader-follower dynamics.

### Page 15, Paragraph 3

This paragraph evaluates trading strategies based on the identified leader-follower relationships. The results show significant returns even after accounting for known return predictors and transaction costs, implying that these strategies effectively exploit slow information diffusion between firms.

## Data and Data Fields Used

- **Data Sources**: CRSP for stock returns, Thomson-Reuters News Analytics for news data.
- **Frequency**: Monthly and weekly stock returns.
- **Fields**:
  - Stock return data
  - Market capitalization
  - Industry classification
  - News story counts and relevance
  - Firm fundamentals like size, turnover, age
  - Institutional ownership and analyst coverage

The regression analysis uses lagged returns of stock pairs and market return to compute predictive relationships.

## Reflection

This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of cross-firm information diffusion and its practical implications for return predictability. It departs from standard approaches by not relying on structural firm links and instead applies a data-driven method to detect predictive stock pairs. The study's demonstration of exploitable trading strategies based on leader-follower signals challenges the efficient market hypothesis and opens pathways for quantitative investors to develop new models.
