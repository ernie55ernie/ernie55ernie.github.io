House passed 222-209, Senate 60-40. **Why it matters:** Federal agencies (SEC, CFTC) reopen, enabling resumed crypto ETF reviews, regulatory guidance, and economic data releases. Shutdown delayed CPI/PPI reports, causing Fed rate-cut odds to drop from 92% to 58%. BTC recovered ~6.7% from \$99.3K lows to above \$105K on news. Funding expires Jan 30, 2026. {Primary: White House statement, Reuters; Secondary: CoinDesk, ForkLog}[^5][^17][^18][^19][^20]

**{High} — SEC Launches "Project Crypto" Token Taxonomy (Nov 12)**
SEC Chair Paul Atkins unveiled **Project Crypto** at Fed Reserve Bank of Philadelphia event Nov 12. Initiative will categorize digital assets into: (1) Digital commodities/network tokens, (2) Digital collectibles, (3) Digital tools, (4) Tokenized securities. Framework anchored in Howey Test but clarifies "investment contracts can expire"—tokens sold via investment contract don't "remain securities forever". SEC preparing exemption package to "streamline capital formation" for crypto projects. **Why it matters:** Ends "decade of uncertainty" on crypto securities classification; shifts from enforcement-first to clarity-first regime; coordinates with CFTC. {Primary: SEC Chair speech transcript; Secondary: Gibson Dunn, CoinDesk}[^25][^26][^27][^28]

**{Medium} — Binance Lists Lorenzo Protocol (BANK) and Meteora (MET) Nov 13 (14:00 UTC | 22:00 CST)**
Binance spot trading for **BANK/USDT, MET/USDT** and other pairs goes live Nov 13 14:00 UTC (first Solana ecosystem listing in 6 months). Deposits opened 13:00 UTC, withdrawals Nov 14 14:00 UTC. Both carry **Seed Tag** (high-volatility, early-stage projects). BANK spiked **+60%**, MET +10% pre-listing. **Why it matters:** Signals renewed Binance confidence in Solana DeFi; however, MET faced controversy—wallets linked to TRUMP meme-coin insiders received \$4.2M in MET airdrop. Traders must complete 90-day Seed Tag quiz to trade. {Primary: Binance announcement; Secondary: CoinGabbar, BeInCrypto}[^29][^30]

**{Medium} — Monad (MON) Public Sale Nov 17-22 on Coinbase (09:00 ET Nov 17 / 22:00 UTC Nov 16)**
Monad Foundation launches **7.5% of total supply** (7.5B MON) via Coinbase Token Sales platform at **\$0.025/token** (\$187.5M if fully subscribed). Sale runs Nov 17-22 (closes 21:00 ET Nov 22 / 02:00 UTC Nov 23). Mainnet launches **Nov 24**. MON is EVM-compatible Layer-1 targeting Solana-level performance. Total supply 100B; 50.6% locked at launch. **Why it matters:** First token sale on Coinbase's new regulated platform (acquired Echo/Sonar for \$400M); tests retail appetite for Layer-1s; \$2.5B FDV ambitious relative to adoption. {Primary: Monad Foundation announcement; Secondary: CoinDesk, Mexc}[^31][^32][^33][^34]

**{Medium} — Hyperliquid HLP Vault Loses \$4.9M in POPCAT Manipulation Attack (Nov 12)**
Attacker deliberately lost **\$3M collateral** to inflict **\$4.9M loss** on Hyperliquid's HLP (Hyperliquidity Provider) vault via POPCAT perpetual market manipulation. Attack: withdrew \$3M USDC from OKX, split across 19 wallets, built \$26M leveraged long POPCAT positions, erected \$20M buy wall at \$0.21, then canceled wall → liquidity collapse → cascading liquidations. Attacker's own position liquidated; HLP absorbed losses. Hyperliquid paused HLP deposits/withdrawals; Arbitrum bridge locked for ~25 min via "vote emergency lock," then reopened. **Why it matters:** Third Hyperliquid market manipulation attack in 2025; exposes vulnerabilities in automated liquidity provider vaults on perp DEXs; demonstrates "loss-leading" attacks (attacker accepts losses to damage protocol). Similar to March JELLYJELLY exploit. {Primary: Lookonchain on-chain analysis; Secondary: XT.com, CryptoRank}[^35][^36][^37][^38][^39]

**{Low} — Balancer V2 Exploited for \$128M (Nov 3)**
Hackers drained **\$128M** from Balancer V2 Composable Stable Pools via rounding-error flaw in swap calculation logic. Attack chained hundreds of `batchSwap` operations; each swap rounded down slightly, compounding into large discrepancies. Only V2 pools affected; V3 secure. Balancer paused affected pools, coordinating with forensics. **Why it matters:** Despite 11+ audits since 2021, micro-errors in economic logic can cause macro losses when attackers chain operations. Phishing scams impersonating Balancer emerged post-breach. Highlights need for continuous behavioral monitoring, not just pre-deployment audits. {Primary: Balancer official statement; Secondary: ClearPhish Analysis, TheRecord}[^40][^41]

**{Low} — China Accuses U.S. of \$13B Bitcoin Hack (Nov 11)**
Chinese National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center claims U.S. government orchestrated **127,272 BTC theft** (\$13B) from LuBian mining pool in Dec 2020. Report alleges "state-level hacker operation"; links stolen BTC to tokens later seized by U.S. DOJ from Chen Zhi (Prince Group chairman) indicted for wire fraud/money laundering in Oct 2025. U.S. filed civil forfeiture complaint for 127,271 BTC (largest-ever crypto forfeiture). U.S. declined comment on seizure method. **Why it matters:** Escalates U.S.-China cyber attribution tensions; raises questions about government cyber operations in crypto space. {Primary: Chinese NCVERC report; Secondary: Bloomberg, Business Standard}[^42][^43][^44]

### **Security Incidents**

**{High} — Hyperliquid HLP Vault: \$4.9M Loss via POPCAT Manipulation (Nov 12)**
Attacker sacrificed \$3M collateral to manipulate POPCAT perpetual market, inflicting \$4.9M loss on Hyperliquid's Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault. Method: Built \$26M leveraged long POPCAT positions across 19 wallets funded from OKX, erected \$20M buy wall at \$0.21 to create demand illusion, canceled wall → liquidity collapse → cascading liquidations. Attacker fully liquidated; HLP absorbed positions and losses. Bridge auto-locked 25 min, then reopened. **Amount at risk:** \$4.9M. **Mitigation:** HLP paused deposits/withdrawals; manually closed positions. Third such attack on Hyperliquid in 2025. {Confirmed: Lookonchain on-chain data; Official: Hyperliquid dev Iliensinc Discord statement}[^36][^37][^39][^35][^38]

**{High} — Balancer V2: \$128M Exploit via Rounding Error (Nov 3)**
Hackers exploited rounding-down vulnerability in Balancer V2 Composable Stable Pools' swap calculation, chaining hundreds of `batchSwap` operations to drain **\$128M** (\$99M in ETH). Only V2 pools affected; V3 secure. **Amount at risk:** \$128M. **Mitigation:** Balancer paused affected pools, engaged forensics; some funds frozen by affiliated platforms (Berachain, Gnosis, Sonic, Beefy). Phishing scams impersonating Balancer's security team circulated post-breach. {Confirmed: Blockchain security firms; Official: Balancer statement}[^41][^40]

**{Medium} — Moonwell: \$1M Hack, \$3.7M Bad Debt via Oracle Exploit (Nov ~10)**

- **BTC \$100K defense**: Bitcoin consolidating \$100K-\$103K. Break below \$100K would invalidate bullish structure; target \$97K support. Break above \$106K opens path to \$111K-\$113K.[^3][^1][^2]

**Nov 13, ~17:00 UTC (Nov 14 01:00 CST):**

- **U.S. CPI data release (if resumed)**: Government reopening enables delayed Oct CPI/PPI reports. CPI print critical for Fed Dec rate-cut odds (currently 52%). High inflation → risk-off → crypto pressure.[^69][^19][^5]

- **Monad (MON) public sale & mainnet**: Sale Nov 17 09:00 ET - Nov 22 21:00 ET (14:00 UTC Nov 17 - 02:00 UTC Nov 23). Mainnet launches **Nov 24**. \$2.5B FDV at \$0.025/token → watch for price discovery post-TGE; early seller pressure from 7.5% unlocked supply.[^33][^31][^32]

**Dec 3, 21:49 UTC (Dec 4, 05:49 CST):**

- **Ethereum Fusaka upgrade**: Major scalability upgrade activates. Watch for network stability, ETH price reaction (precedent: Pectra upgrade → +53% rally), and Layer-2 transaction cost reduction.[^60][^61]

**Unlocks/Expiries:**

- **Jan 30, 2026**: U.S. government funding expires → potential shutdown redux if no new deal.[^19]

**Maintenance:**

- **Nov 23, 00:00-06:00 SGT (Nov 22 16:00-22:00 UTC)**: Gemini Exchange bank system maintenance; SGD/USD deposit pauses.[^71]
