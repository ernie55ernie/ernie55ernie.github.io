  Hello there! My name is Yu-Wei Chang, and you may call me ernie.
  I see programming as a hobby so I would spend some effort gathering
  information on some of the topics, such as social media application
  interface usage, frameworks for data mining and machine learning... etc.
  This website contains programs that I code at my leisure time.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://ernie55ernie.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
